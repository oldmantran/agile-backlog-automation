        enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
        - criterion: Dashboard loads within 3 seconds under normal conditions with
            up to 100 concurrent users.
          rationale: Added specificity regarding concurrent users to define 'normal
            conditions' for performance testing.
        - criterion: Real-time updates are reflected across all connected devices
            for the same user within 5 seconds of a status change.
          rationale: Added a measurable time frame for updates to ensure testability
            and define acceptable latency.
        - criterion: All carrier data is normalized and displayed consistently regardless
            of source, including status terminology, date formats (MM/DD/YYYY), and
            location coordinates (latitude/longitude precision to 4 decimal places).
          rationale: Added specific examples of data normalization to make the criterion
            testable with clear expectations.
        - criterion: Dashboard displays an error message within 5 seconds if data
            from any carrier fails to load, specifying which carrier's data is unavailable.
          rationale: Added to ensure error handling is covered and provides a measurable
            outcome for failure scenarios.
        - criterion: Dashboard supports accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 Level AA),
            including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility for all
            displayed data.
          rationale: Added to ensure usability for all users, with a specific standard
            for testability.

            testing.
        - area: Real-Time Updates
          recommendation: Specify the mechanism for real-time updates (e.g., WebSocket,
            polling) and acceptable latency thresholds across different device types
            and network conditions.
        - area: Data Normalization
          recommendation: Provide a detailed mapping or examples of how data from
            different carriers should be normalized (e.g., status terms like 'In Transit'
            vs 'On the Way') to avoid ambiguity during testing.
        - area: Error Handling
          recommendation: Include criteria for partial data loads, timeout scenarios,
            and user notifications to ensure robust failure handling.
        - area: Security and Access
          recommendation: Add criteria for user authentication, role-based access
            to specific shipment data, and protection against common vulnerabilities
            like XSS or unauthorized data access.

          enhanced_score: 9
          explanation: Original criteria lacked specificity in performance conditions,
            update latency, error handling, and accessibility requirements, making
            them difficult to test comprehensively. Enhanced criteria provide measurable
            outcomes and cover broader scenarios, increasing testability.

      enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
      - Notifications for critical shipment status changes (e.g., delay, exception,
        delivery failure) must be delivered via user-selected channels (email, SMS,
        in-app) within 1 minute of the status update, verifiable through system logs
        or monitoring tools.
      - Users can configure notification preferences to opt in or out of specific
        notification types (e.g., delays only) and channels (e.g., email only) via
        their profile settings, with changes applied immediately.
      - Notification logs, including timestamp, recipient, channel, status (sent/failed),
        and content, must be stored and accessible to authorized users for audit purposes
        for at least 90 days.
      - If a notification fails to deliver (e.g., invalid email, SMS bounce), the
        system must log the failure and retry delivery at least once within 5 minutes.
      - Users must receive a confirmation message or visual indicator in the app when
        notification preferences are updated successfully.
      - The system must prevent notification spam by limiting identical status change
        alerts to one per user per shipment within a 10-minute window.

      recommendations_for_improvement:
      - area: Specificity of Triggers
        recommendation: Define which specific shipment status changes (e.g., delay,
          exception, delivery failure) trigger notifications to avoid ambiguity during
          testing.
      - area: Delivery Time Validation
        recommendation: Specify tools or methods (e.g., system logs, monitoring dashboards)
          to measure the 'within 1 minute' delivery requirement for accurate performance
          testing.
      - area: User Preferences
        recommendation: Include granular control over notification types and channels
          to ensure test scenarios cover diverse user configurations.
      - area: Error Handling
        recommendation: Add criteria for handling delivery failures (retries, user
          alerts) and system errors to ensure robust testing of negative scenarios.
      - area: Audit Logs
        recommendation: Define retention period and access permissions for logs to
          ensure compliance and security testing scenarios are covered.

        reason_for_score: The current criteria provide a basic framework but lack

          types of status changes triggering notifications, user preferences for notification
          types, and error handling. Measurability for 'within 1 minute' is also unclear
          without defined tools or methods for validation.

      feature: Shipment Location Mapping & Visualization
      review:
        current_acceptance_criteria:
        - Map loads and renders within 5 seconds on standard connections.
        - Location data accuracy is within 100 meters where carrier data permits.
        - Map supports zoom and pan for detailed inspection.
        enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
        - Map loads and renders within 5 seconds on standard internet connections
          (defined as 10 Mbps download speed).
        - Location data accuracy is within 100 meters for at least 95% of updates
          where carrier data permits, with clear indication to the user when accuracy
          falls below this threshold.
        - Map supports zoom levels from 1x to 20x and pan functionality across all
          visible areas without visual glitches or data loss.
        - Real-time shipment location updates are reflected on the map within 10 seconds
          of receiving new data from the carrier.
        - Route history for the past 24 hours is displayed accurately on the map with
          timestamps for key location points.
        - Estimated delivery path is visually distinct from the actual route taken
          and updates dynamically based on real-time data.
        - Map interface remains responsive (no UI freezes or delays over 2 seconds)
          during zoom, pan, or data refresh operations.
        - Error messages are displayed to the user if map data fails to load or if
          location data is unavailable for more than 30 seconds.
        - Map visualization is accessible, supporting screen readers with descriptive
          labels for shipment locations and routes.

        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - area: Performance
          recommendation: Define 'standard connections' with specific bandwidth and
            latency values to ensure consistent performance testing. Include benchmarks
            for different device types (desktop, mobile).
        - area: Accuracy
          recommendation: Specify how accuracy degradation is communicated to users
            and define a fallback mechanism when carrier data is unreliable.
        - area: User Experience
          recommendation: Add criteria for mobile responsiveness and touch gestures
            (e.g., pinch-to-zoom) to ensure usability across devices.
        - area: Accessibility
          recommendation: Incorporate WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance as a measurable
            standard for map visualization and interaction.
        - area: Error Handling
          recommendation: Define expected behavior for scenarios like loss of internet
            connection, incomplete carrier data, or API failures.
        testability_score:
          current_score: 6
          enhanced_score: 9
          reason: The original criteria lacked specificity in performance benchmarks,
            error handling, real-time update expectations, and accessibility requirements.
            Enhanced criteria provide measurable thresholds, cover edge cases, and
            include user experience aspects, making them more testable.

      recommendations_for_improvement:
      - area: Specificity of Carriers
        recommendation: Define the exact list of 'major carriers' to be supported
          at launch to avoid ambiguity during testing. This ensures test coverage
          for each carrier's API quirks.
      - area: Performance Metrics
        recommendation: Specify acceptable response times and throughput for data
          refresh (both scheduled and on-demand) to enable precise performance testing.
      - area: Error Handling
        recommendation: Include criteria for handling carrier API downtimes, rate
          limiting, and malformed data to ensure robust system behavior under adverse
          conditions.
      - area: Data Accuracy
        recommendation: Add criteria for validating the accuracy of normalized data
          against carrier-provided data to catch transformation errors.
      - area: Scalability
        recommendation: Define 'normal conditions' with concrete numbers (e.g., API
          call volume per hour) and include criteria for peak load scenarios to ensure
          system stability.
      review:
        analysis: The current acceptance criteria provide a basic framework for testing
          but lack specificity and measurable outcomes in several areas. While they
          define high-level goals, they miss details on error handling, performance
          under load, data normalization accuracy, and edge cases. Additionally, terms
          like 'major carriers' and 'normal conditions' are ambiguous and need clarification
          for effective test design.

            for performance testing.
        - aspect: Usability
          recommendation: "Include criteria for user interactions such as sorting,\
            \ filtering, and drilling down into shipment details to ensure the dashboard\
            \ supports logistics managers\u2019 workflows."
        - aspect: Accessibility
          recommendation: Explicitly test for screen reader compatibility and alternative
            text for visual elements like charts or color-coded indicators.
        - aspect: Data Accuracy
          recommendation: Add criteria to validate the accuracy of predictions against
            historical data or manual verification to ensure trust in AI/ML outputs.
        - aspect: Security
          recommendation: Include requirements for data protection, such as masking

        targeting.
      - Include requirements for notification content format and mandatory fields
        to validate consistency.
      - Add criteria for handling notification failures (e.g., retries, fallback methods)
        to cover error scenarios.
      - Clarify performance expectations for high-volume scenarios (e.g., maximum
        notifications per minute) to enable load testing.
      - Include accessibility requirements for notification content (e.g., readable
        by screen readers for in-app alerts).

      feature: Delay Prediction Model Integration
      review:
        enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
        - The AI/ML model integrates with GRIT via REST APIs, achieving a 99% success
          rate for API calls and response times under 200ms for 95% of requests under
          normal load (100 concurrent users).
        - The system returns delay predictions with an accuracy of at least 80%, validated
          against historical data over a 30-day period.
        - Predictions and associated metadata (e.g., timestamp, confidence score,
          input factors) are stored in the database with a retention period of at
          least 12 months.
        - Database queries for historical analysis return results in under 5 seconds
          for 95% of requests.
        - External data sources (weather, traffic) are updated at least every 6 hours,
          with fallback to cached data if updates fail, ensuring no prediction is
          based on data older than 24 hours.
        - API endpoints are secured with OAuth 2.0 authentication and data is encrypted
          in transit (TLS 1.2 or higher) and at rest (AES-256).
        - In case of model failure or API unavailability, the system displays a user-friendly
          error message and falls back to a default heuristic (e.g., historical average
          delay).
        - Users can view prediction reports in the GRIT UI, including delay likelihood,
          confidence score, and contributing factors, updated within 10 seconds of
          a new prediction.

        original_acceptance_criteria:
        - AI/ML model integrates seamlessly with GRIT via REST APIs.
        - Predictions are stored in a database for historical analysis and reporting.
        reason_for_score: The current acceptance criteria are vague and lack specific,
          measurable outcomes. Terms like 'seamlessly' are subjective and not testable.
          There are no details on performance benchmarks, error handling, or accuracy
          metrics, which are critical for an AI/ML integration.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - Define specific API response times and success rates for integration (e.g.,
          99% uptime, <200ms response time).
        - Specify accuracy thresholds for predictions (e.g., prediction accuracy >80%).
        - Include criteria for error handling and fallback mechanisms if the model
          fails to predict or API is unavailable.
        - Detail database storage requirements (e.g., retention period, data format,
          query performance).

        reason_for_score: The current criteria provide a basic framework for testing
          but lack specificity in key areas such as error handling, data accuracy,
          user roles, and edge cases. Performance criteria are measurable, but integration
          and UI criteria are vague without defined success metrics or scenarios.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - area: Specificity in Integration
          recommendation: Define acceptable API response formats, latency thresholds,
            and error handling mechanisms (e.g., retry policies, caching) to ensure
            robust integration testing.
        - area: Performance Metrics
          recommendation: Expand performance criteria to include peak load scenarios
            (e.g., 5000 requests/minute) and define acceptable degradation thresholds
            for response times under stress.
        - area: User Experience
          recommendation: Add criteria for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 compliance) and
            multi-language support in the UI to ensure inclusivity and usability testing
            coverage.
        - area: Security
          recommendation: Include criteria for securing API communications (e.g.,
            HTTPS, API key validation) and protecting user data during route selection
            to enable security testing.

            size or timeframe for comparison.
        - area: User Permissions

            test cases cover unauthorized access attempts.
        - area: UI Specifications
          recommendation: Provide detailed UI mockups or wireframes to validate 'clear
            comparison' (e.g., font size, color contrast for accessibility, mobile
            responsiveness).
        - area: Integration Points
          recommendation: Document external data sources (e.g., traffic APIs, toll
            databases) and their expected update frequency to ensure test coverage
            for integration failures.

            user needs.
          scenario: Testing accessibility of notification preferences and route recommendation
            interfaces for users with disabilities (e.g., screen reader compatibility).
          type: usability
        - reason: Missing explicit coverage for third-party dependencies which are
            core to system functionality.
          scenario: Testing integration with external systems (e.g., traffic APIs,
            mapping services) for data accuracy and latency in route recommendations.
          type: integration
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - area: Disruption Detection
          recommendation: Define specific disruption sources (e.g., third-party traffic
            APIs, weather services) and acceptable failure scenarios for the remaining
            10% of undetected events to allow targeted testing of detection accuracy.
        - area: Alert Delivery
          recommendation: Specify acceptable failure conditions for alert delivery
            (e.g., network outage) and fallback mechanisms (e.g., retry attempts)
            to ensure comprehensive error handling tests.
        - area: Route Recommendation
          recommendation: "Include criteria for handling cases where no viable alternative\
            \ route exists or when ETA deviation exceeds 10%, ensuring the system\u2019\
            s behavior is defined and testable."
        - area: User Experience
          recommendation: Add criteria for user acknowledgment of alerts/route changes
            (e.g., mandatory confirmation before route update) to test usability and
            interaction flows.
        testability_score:
          enhanced_score: 9
          original_score: 6
          reason: Original criteria lacked specificity in disruption types, measurable
            outcomes for route recommendations, and logging requirements. Enhanced
            criteria provide clearer metrics, scope, and verifiable outcomes, improving
            testability significantly. Score not 10 due to potential challenges in
            simulating real-time disruptions consistently for testing.

    - Implement real-time monitoring with WebSocket or polling mechanisms.
    - Optimize alert system for high-frequency updates without performance degradation.

        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - area: Performance
          recommendation: Define 'standard queries' explicitly (e.g., number of records
            or complexity) to ensure consistent performance testing. Include scenarios
            for peak load conditions.
        - area: Data Retention
          recommendation: Specify how data older than 12 months is handled (e.g.,
            archived, deleted) and whether users are notified of data unavailability.
        - area: Export Functionality
          recommendation: Add criteria for handling large datasets during export (e.g.,
            timeout behavior, maximum file size) and format validation for CSV/PDF
            outputs.
        - area: User Experience
          recommendation: Include criteria for accessibility (e.g., WCAG 2.1 compliance)
            and mobile responsiveness to ensure usability across devices.
        - area: Security
          recommendation: Add criteria for data access controls and encryption of
            exported reports to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive analytics.
        testability_score:
          enhanced_score: 8
          original_score: 5
          reason: Original criteria lacked specificity around user roles, error handling,
            data accuracy, and performance boundaries, making them difficult to test
            comprehensively. Enhanced criteria add measurable thresholds, user permissions,
            and interaction details, improving testability.

        description: Integrate GRIT with Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) to streamline
          warehouse operations by syncing inventory movements, pick-and-pack statuses,
          and storage locations. This feature ensures Operations Managers have real-time
          visibility into warehouse activities.
        enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
        - criterion: WMS integration must support real-time updates for inventory
            movements, pick-and-pack statuses, and storage locations with a maximum
            latency of 5 seconds between WMS and GRIT systems.
          testable_aspect: Latency and data accuracy for real-time updates.
        - criterion: Sync process must handle high-volume warehouse data, processing
            at least 5,000 updates per hour, with system response time remaining under
            2 seconds per transaction and no data loss or duplication.
          testable_aspect: Performance under load, data integrity.
        - criterion: Integration must provide error notifications to Operations Managers
            via email or dashboard alerts within 60 seconds if sync fails or data
            discrepancies are detected between WMS and GRIT.
          testable_aspect: Error handling and notification timeliness.
        - criterion: WMS integration must support bidirectional data flow, allowing
            updates initiated from GRIT to reflect in WMS and vice versa, with data
            consistency maintained across both systems.
          testable_aspect: Bidirectional sync accuracy.
        - criterion: Integration must comply with data security standards, ensuring
            all data transferred between WMS and GRIT is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or
            higher, and access is restricted to authorized roles (e.g., Operations
            Managers).

        original_acceptance_criteria:
        - WMS integration supports real-time updates for inventory movements and pick-and-pack
          statuses.
        - Sync process handles high-volume warehouse data (up to 5,000 updates/hour)
          without performance degradation.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - impact: Improves ability to validate system behavior against clear benchmarks.
          recommendation: Define specific thresholds for 'real-time updates' (e.g.,
            maximum acceptable latency) to enable precise performance testing.
        - impact: Ensures system reliability under adverse conditions.
          recommendation: Include detailed error handling scenarios, such as types
            of sync failures and expected recovery mechanisms, to ensure robust testing
            of failure modes.
        - impact: Reduces ambiguity in integration scope and test design.
          recommendation: Specify supported WMS platforms or protocols (e.g., API
            standards, data formats) to focus integration testing on compatibility.
        - impact: Ensures system readiness for future growth or unexpected demand.
          recommendation: Add criteria for handling peak load beyond 5,000 updates/hour
            to prepare for scalability testing.
        - impact: Improves end-user experience and adoption.
          recommendation: Incorporate accessibility and usability criteria for Operations
            Managers interacting with the synced data (e.g., dashboard visibility,
            mobile access).
        testability_score:
          enhanced_score: 8
          original_score: 4
          reason_for_enhanced_score: Enhanced criteria include specific, measurable
            targets (e.g., latency under 5 seconds, response time under 2 seconds)
            and cover broader aspects like security and error handling, improving
            testability. Score is not 10 due to potential need for further definition
            of edge cases and specific failure scenarios.
          reason_for_original_score: Original criteria lack specificity in measurable
            outcomes (e.g., latency, error handling) and miss critical aspects like
            security and bidirectional sync, making them difficult to test comprehensively.

        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - Define specific latency thresholds and accuracy percentages for shipment
          status updates to enable precise pass/fail criteria in testing.
        - Include user role-specific criteria (e.g., what Customer Service Representatives
          should see and do with the data).
        - Add criteria for error handling, such as how the system behaves during TMS
          downtime or data inconsistencies.
        - Specify supported TMS vendors or API standards to ensure compatibility testing
          is scoped appropriately.
        - Include security requirements, such as authentication and data encryption
          between GRIT and TMS, to address potential vulnerabilities.
        testability_score:
          current_score: 4
          enhanced_reason: Enhanced criteria include measurable thresholds (e.g.,
            5 seconds latency, 99.9% accuracy, 1,000 shipments/hour), user-specific
            outcomes, and error handling scenarios, improving testability. However,
            further clarification on TMS vendor-specific behaviors or API constraints
            could elevate this to a 9 or 10.
          enhanced_score: 8
          reason: Current criteria lack specificity (e.g., 'minimal latency' is vague,
            no measurable threshold provided) and do not cover error handling, user
            experience, or edge cases. This makes it difficult to design precise test
            cases or validate outcomes.

        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - Define specific performance benchmarks for dashboard load times and alert
          delivery under varying system loads (e.g., 100 vs. 10,000 transactions).
        - Specify acceptable error margins for 'real-time' status updates (e.g., allowable
          delay in seconds).
        - Include criteria for accessibility compliance (e.g., WCAG 2.1 Level AA)
          to ensure the dashboard is usable by all relevant staff.
        - Add criteria for handling edge cases, such as behavior when integrations
          are partially available or when the dashboard itself loses connectivity.
        - Clarify data retention policies for historical data (e.g., how long data
          is stored, how it can be accessed or exported).
        testability_score:
          current_score: 4
          enhanced_score: 8
          rationale: The original criteria lack specificity in terms of measurable
            outcomes (e.g., refresh rate, alert timing), user roles, and detailed
            error handling. The enhanced criteria provide clear, testable metrics
            and scenarios, improving testability significantly. However, some aspects
            like performance under high load still need detailed benchmarks.

        - Include performance benchmarks for onboarding and configuration updates
          (e.g., max time for validation).
        - Specify accessibility requirements for the interface (e.g., WCAG 2.1 compliance).
        - Clarify supported integration versions or protocols for ERP, WMS, and TMS
          systems.
        - Add criteria for handling failed validations or onboarding attempts, including
          user notifications and recovery options.

          reason: Current criteria are vague and lack specific, measurable outcomes.
            Enhanced criteria add specificity (e.g., error messages, time constraints,
            rollback support) and cover more functional aspects, making them more
            testable.

        reason_for_score: The current acceptance criteria provide a high-level overview
          of expected functionality but lack specificity in measurable outcomes, edge
          cases, and error handling. Key details such as types of exceptions, logging
          formats, and notification recipients are undefined, making comprehensive
          testing challenging.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - Specify the types of exceptions (e.g., delay, damage, route deviation) and
          associated predefined rules for detection to ensure consistent test coverage.
        - Define 'relevant details' for logging (e.g., timestamp, exception type,
          shipment ID, severity) to make audit logging testable.
        - Clarify notification requirements (e.g., recipient roles, delivery channels
          like email/SMS, content format) and acceptable latency thresholds under
          varying conditions.
        - Include criteria for false positive handling and exception resolution workflows
          to cover end-to-end functionality.
        - Add performance benchmarks for system scalability under high exception volumes
          to ensure reliability.

        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - area: Specificity
          recommendation: Define exact severity levels and associated prioritization
            rules in the criteria to ensure consistent testing (e.g., Critical = immediate
            action, Low = deferred).
        - area: Performance
          recommendation: Include criteria for system behavior under load (e.g., exception
            categorization during peak traffic) to validate scalability.
        - area: User Experience
          recommendation: Add criteria for user feedback mechanisms (e.g., confirmation
            messages, error handling during overrides) to ensure usability.
        - area: Security
          recommendation: Specify which user roles can override priorities to prevent
            unauthorized access and ensure permission-based testing.
        testability_score:
          enhanced_score: 9
          original_score: 6
          reasoning: Original criteria lacked specificity in measurable outcomes (e.g.,
            severity levels, response times for overrides, performance benchmarks)
            and missed critical aspects like notifications and permissions. Enhanced
            criteria add clear, testable metrics and cover broader scenarios, improving
            testability significantly.

      recommendations_for_improvement:
      - aspect: Specificity of Critical Exceptions
        recommendation: Define severity levels and types of exceptions that trigger
          escalations to ensure consistent testing (e.g., database failure as severity
          1, API timeout as severity 2).
      - aspect: Escalation Channels
        recommendation: Specify supported communication channels and their priority
          order for escalations to test channel-specific behaviors and fallbacks.
      - aspect: Error Handling
        recommendation: Include criteria for handling failed escalations, retries,
          and fallback mechanisms to ensure robustness under adverse conditions.
      - aspect: User Roles and Permissions
        recommendation: Clarify which user roles can configure or override escalation
          rules to test access control and prevent unauthorized changes.
      - aspect: Performance Metrics
        recommendation: Add acceptable thresholds for system performance under high
          load (e.g., 100 escalations per minute) to validate scalability.
      review:
        analysis: The current acceptance criteria provide a basic framework for testing
          but lack specificity in several areas, such as defining 'critical exceptions,'
          escalation channels, failure scenarios, and recovery mechanisms. The criteria
          are measurable but incomplete for ensuring comprehensive test coverage.
        current_acceptance_criteria:
        - Escalations occur within 5 minutes of meeting criteria for critical exceptions.
        - All escalations are logged with timestamps and recipient details.
        - System prevents duplicate escalations for the same issue.

          testing.
      - area: Performance
        recommendation: Include scenarios for datasets beyond 10,000 exceptions to
          test scalability and define expected behavior for timeouts or failures.
      - area: Audit Logging
        recommendation: Specify log retention period, format, and access permissions
          to ensure security and compliance testing can be conducted.
      - area: User Experience
        recommendation: Add criteria for user notifications and UI feedback to cover
          the end-to-end user journey.
      - area: Accessibility
        recommendation: Include requirements for WCAG compliance in report views and
          status update interfaces to ensure accessibility testing.
      testability_score:

      recommendations_for_improvement:
      - area: Performance Testing
        recommendation: Define specific network conditions and device specifications
          for load time testing to ensure repeatability. Include tests for weaker
          network conditions (e.g., 3G or poor signal).
      - area: Error Handling
        recommendation: Add criteria for handling edge cases such as server downtime,
          no active shipments, or GPS inaccuracies to ensure robust error messaging
          and fallback behavior.
      - area: Usability and Accessibility
        recommendation: Incorporate WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance requirements to ensure
          the app is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., screen reader support,
          color contrast ratios).
      - area: Security
        recommendation: Include criteria for data encryption during transmission and
          at rest, as well as authentication checks to prevent unauthorized access
          to shipment data.
      review:
        analysis: The current acceptance criteria provide a basic framework for performance
          and functionality testing but lack specificity in several areas, such as
          defining 'standard network conditions,' handling error states, and addressing
          usability or accessibility. Additionally, they miss critical scenarios like
          offline behavior, data accuracy, and user interaction flows.

        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - Define specific alert types and severity levels to ensure consistent testing
          (e.g., delay alerts for >30 minutes as 'high severity').
        - Specify the format and content of notifications (e.g., must include shipment
          ID, issue type) to validate user experience.
        - Add criteria for handling edge cases, such as network failures or duplicate
          notifications, to ensure robust system behavior.
        - Include accessibility requirements for notifications (e.g., support for
          screen readers, high-contrast mode).
        - Clarify expected behavior when the user is offline or the device is in 'Do
          Not Disturb' mode.
        testability_score:
          current_score: 6
          reason: The original criteria lack specificity in terms of measurable outcomes,
            user interaction details, and edge case handling. The delivery time is
            testable, but 'configure notification preferences' is vague without details
            on what can be configured and expected behavior.

        - area: Performance
          recommendation: Define specific network conditions (e.g., 3G/4G/5G latency
            and bandwidth) for load time testing to ensure consistent results. Include
            peak usage scenarios for stress testing.
        - area: Usability
          recommendation: Specify supported devices, OS versions, and browsers to
            ensure consistent rendering and functionality across platforms.
        - area: Accessibility
          recommendation: Incorporate explicit WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance requirements
            to ensure the dashboard is usable by all users, including those with disabilities.
        - area: Error Handling
          recommendation: Define expected behavior for data loading failures, including
            specific error messages and user recovery options.
        testability_score:
          enhanced_score: 9
          original_score: 5
          reason: Original criteria lacked specificity on metrics accuracy, real-time

          delivery rate is calculated).
        - Specify acceptable error margins or tolerances for performance metrics.
        - Include criteria for handling larger datasets (beyond 10 carriers or 12
          months) to test scalability.
        - Add requirements for user interaction (e.g., filtering, sorting, or exporting
          data).
        - Clarify expected behavior for edge cases like no data, partial data, or
          system downtime.
        - Incorporate security and data privacy requirements to address potential
          risks.
        - Detail expectations for mobile responsiveness or cross-browser compatibility.

        - Clarify the volume of data or number of carriers the system must handle
          to support performance testing scenarios.
        - Include requirements for handling historical data corrections or retroactive
          SLA updates for accurate reporting.

          reports to ensure usability testing coverage.
        testability_score:
          current_score: 5
          enhanced_reason: Enhanced criteria provide measurable thresholds (e.g.,
            99.5% accuracy, 5-minute delivery), specific timings (2:00 AM UTC), and
            detailed requirements for alerts and reports, improving testability. However,

            still need clarification.
          enhanced_score: 8
          reason: Current criteria lack specificity in terms of timing, accuracy metrics,
            delivery methods, and report details, making it difficult to design precise

        - Scorecards must support at least 10 customizable metrics, each with user-defined
          weights ranging from 0% to 100%, with the total weight across all metrics
          summing to 100%.
        - Scores must be recalculated and displayed within 5 seconds after applying
          or updating a scorecard, with a visible loading indicator during recalculation.
        - Users must receive a clear error message if the total weight of metrics
          does not equal 100% upon saving a scorecard.
        - Scorecards must allow saving and retrieval of custom configurations for
          reuse across multiple carriers or time periods.
        - The system must validate metric inputs to prevent invalid data (e.g., negative
          weights, non-numeric values) and provide specific error feedback.
        - Scorecards must be accessible to users with appropriate permissions only,
          with unauthorized access attempts logged and denied.

        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - area: Input Validation
          recommendation: Define acceptable ranges and formats for metric weights
            and KPI values to ensure consistent test scenarios for invalid inputs.
        - area: Performance
          recommendation: Specify performance expectations under varying loads (e.g.,
            score recalculation time for 1 vs. 1000 carriers) to cover scalability
            testing.
        - area: User Experience
          recommendation: Add criteria for usability, such as intuitive UI feedback
            during scorecard creation and modification, to ensure user satisfaction.
        - area: Accessibility
          recommendation: Include compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards to ensure
            the feature is testable for users with disabilities.
        testability_score:
          enhanced_score: 8

            to test comprehensively. Enhanced criteria include measurable outcomes,
            boundary conditions, and user feedback expectations.

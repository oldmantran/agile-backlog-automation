        enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
        - criterion: Dashboard loads within 3 seconds under normal conditions with
            up to 100 concurrent users.
          rationale: Added specificity regarding concurrent users to define 'normal
            conditions' for performance testing.
        - criterion: Real-time updates are reflected across all connected devices
            for the same user within 5 seconds of a status change.
          rationale: Added a measurable time frame for updates to ensure testability
            and define acceptable latency.
        - criterion: All carrier data is normalized and displayed consistently regardless
            of source, including status terminology, date formats (MM/DD/YYYY), and
            location coordinates (latitude/longitude precision to 4 decimal places).
          rationale: Added specific examples of data normalization to make the criterion
            testable with clear expectations.
        - criterion: Dashboard displays an error message within 5 seconds if data
            from any carrier fails to load, specifying which carrier's data is unavailable.
          rationale: Added to ensure error handling is covered and provides a measurable
            outcome for failure scenarios.
        - criterion: Dashboard supports accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 Level AA),
            including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility for all
            displayed data.
          rationale: Added to ensure usability for all users, with a specific standard
            for testability.
        testability_score:
          original_score: 6
          enhanced_score: 9
          explanation: Original criteria lacked specificity in performance conditions,
            update latency, error handling, and accessibility requirements, making
            them difficult to test comprehensively. Enhanced criteria provide measurable
            outcomes and cover broader scenarios, increasing testability.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - area: Performance Testing
          recommendation: Define 'normal conditions' with specific metrics such as
            network latency, user load, and data volume to ensure consistent performance
            testing.
        - area: Real-Time Updates
          recommendation: Specify the mechanism for real-time updates (e.g., WebSocket,
            polling) and acceptable latency thresholds across different device types
            and network conditions.
        - area: Data Normalization
          recommendation: Provide a detailed mapping or examples of how data from
            different carriers should be normalized (e.g., status terms like 'In Transit'
            vs 'On the Way') to avoid ambiguity during testing.
        - area: Error Handling
          recommendation: Include criteria for partial data loads, timeout scenarios,
            and user notifications to ensure robust failure handling.
        - area: Security and Access
          recommendation: Add criteria for user authentication, role-based access
            to specific shipment data, and protection against common vulnerabilities
            like XSS or unauthorized data access.

        description: Automated alerts and notifications for critical shipment status
          changes (e.g., delays, exceptions) delivered via email, SMS, or in-app notifications
          to ensure users are proactively informed of issues.
        current_acceptance_criteria:
        - Notifications are delivered within 1 minute of a status change.
        - Users can opt out of all notifications if desired.
        - Notification logs are available for audit purposes.
        testability_score: 6
        reason_for_score: The current criteria provide a basic framework but lack
          specificity in key areas such as delivery channels (email, SMS, in-app),
          types of status changes triggering notifications, user preferences for notification
          types, and error handling. Measurability for 'within 1 minute' is also unclear
          without defined tools or methods for validation.
      enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
      - Notifications for critical shipment status changes (e.g., delay, exception,
        delivery failure) must be delivered via user-selected channels (email, SMS,
        in-app) within 1 minute of the status update, verifiable through system logs
        or monitoring tools.
      - Users can configure notification preferences to opt in or out of specific
        notification types (e.g., delays only) and channels (e.g., email only) via
        their profile settings, with changes applied immediately.
      - Notification logs, including timestamp, recipient, channel, status (sent/failed),
        and content, must be stored and accessible to authorized users for audit purposes
        for at least 90 days.
      - If a notification fails to deliver (e.g., invalid email, SMS bounce), the
        system must log the failure and retry delivery at least once within 5 minutes.
      - Users must receive a confirmation message or visual indicator in the app when
        notification preferences are updated successfully.
      - The system must prevent notification spam by limiting identical status change
        alerts to one per user per shipment within a 10-minute window.
      recommendations_for_improvement:
      - area: Specificity of Triggers
        recommendation: Define which specific shipment status changes (e.g., delay,
          exception, delivery failure) trigger notifications to avoid ambiguity during
          testing.
      - area: Delivery Time Validation
        recommendation: Specify tools or methods (e.g., system logs, monitoring dashboards)
          to measure the 'within 1 minute' delivery requirement for accurate performance
          testing.
      - area: User Preferences
        recommendation: Include granular control over notification types and channels
          to ensure test scenarios cover diverse user configurations.
      - area: Error Handling
        recommendation: Add criteria for handling delivery failures (retries, user
          alerts) and system errors to ensure robust testing of negative scenarios.
      - area: Audit Logs
        recommendation: Define retention period and access permissions for logs to
          ensure compliance and security testing scenarios are covered.

      review:
        current_acceptance_criteria:
        - Map loads and renders within 5 seconds on standard connections.
        - Location data accuracy is within 100 meters where carrier data permits.
        - Map supports zoom and pan for detailed inspection.
        enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
        - Map loads and renders within 5 seconds on standard internet connections
          (defined as 10 Mbps download speed).
        - Location data accuracy is within 100 meters for at least 95% of updates
          where carrier data permits, with clear indication to the user when accuracy
          falls below this threshold.
        - Map supports zoom levels from 1x to 20x and pan functionality across all
          visible areas without visual glitches or data loss.
        - Real-time shipment location updates are reflected on the map within 10 seconds
          of receiving new data from the carrier.
        - Route history for the past 24 hours is displayed accurately on the map with
          timestamps for key location points.
        - Estimated delivery path is visually distinct from the actual route taken
          and updates dynamically based on real-time data.
        - Map interface remains responsive (no UI freezes or delays over 2 seconds)
          during zoom, pan, or data refresh operations.
        - Error messages are displayed to the user if map data fails to load or if
          location data is unavailable for more than 30 seconds.
        - Map visualization is accessible, supporting screen readers with descriptive
          labels for shipment locations and routes.
        testability_score:
          current_score: 6
          enhanced_score: 9
          reason: The original criteria lacked specificity in performance benchmarks,
            error handling, real-time update expectations, and accessibility requirements.
            Enhanced criteria provide measurable thresholds, cover edge cases, and
            include user experience aspects, making them more testable.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - area: Performance
          recommendation: Define 'standard connections' with specific bandwidth and
            latency values to ensure consistent performance testing. Include benchmarks
            for different device types (desktop, mobile).
        - area: Accuracy
          recommendation: Specify how accuracy degradation is communicated to users
            and define a fallback mechanism when carrier data is unreliable.
        - area: User Experience
          recommendation: Add criteria for mobile responsiveness and touch gestures
            (e.g., pinch-to-zoom) to ensure usability across devices.
        - area: Accessibility
          recommendation: Incorporate WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance as a measurable
            standard for map visualization and interaction.
        - area: Error Handling
          recommendation: Define expected behavior for scenarios like loss of internet
            connection, incomplete carrier data, or API failures.

        current_acceptance_criteria:
        - System supports integration with at least 5 major carriers at launch.
        - Data refresh occurs at least every 5 minutes or on-demand for critical updates.
        - Error rates for API calls remain below 1% under normal conditions.
        testability_score: 6
        analysis: The current acceptance criteria provide a basic framework for testing
          but lack specificity and measurable outcomes in several areas. While they
          define high-level goals, they miss details on error handling, performance
          under load, data normalization accuracy, and edge cases. Additionally, terms
          like 'major carriers' and 'normal conditions' are ambiguous and need clarification
          for effective test design.
      enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
      - criterion: System must integrate with at least 5 specified major carriers
          (e.g., FedEx, UPS, DHL, USPS, and Canada Post) at launch, with successful
          API authentication and data retrieval for each.
        testable_aspect: Verify integration for each carrier by confirming successful
          API calls and receipt of shipment status/location data.
      - criterion: Data refresh must occur automatically at least every 5 minutes
          for active shipments, and on-demand refresh must be available for critical
          updates with a response time of under 10 seconds for 95% of requests.
        testable_aspect: Measure refresh intervals and response times for both scheduled
          and on-demand updates using timestamp logs and performance metrics.
      - criterion: Error rates for API calls must remain below 1% during a 24-hour
          period under normal load (defined as up to 10,000 API calls per hour), with
          detailed error logging for failed calls including carrier name, error code,
          and timestamp.
        testable_aspect: Simulate load conditions and monitor error rates using automated
          scripts, validate error logging format and content.
      - criterion: System must normalize carrier-specific data formats into a unified
          structure (e.g., status as 'In Transit', 'Delivered', etc., and location
          as GPS coordinates) with 99% accuracy for valid data received.
        testable_aspect: Compare normalized output against expected unified format
          for a sample of API responses from each carrier.
      - criterion: System must handle carrier API failures gracefully by retrying
          failed requests up to 3 times within 30 seconds before logging an error
          and notifying administrators if the issue persists.
        testable_aspect: Simulate API failures and verify retry logic, timing, error
          logging, and notification triggers.
      recommendations_for_improvement:
      - area: Specificity of Carriers
        recommendation: Define the exact list of 'major carriers' to be supported
          at launch to avoid ambiguity during testing. This ensures test coverage
          for each carrier's API quirks.
      - area: Performance Metrics
        recommendation: Specify acceptable response times and throughput for data
          refresh (both scheduled and on-demand) to enable precise performance testing.
      - area: Error Handling
        recommendation: Include criteria for handling carrier API downtimes, rate
          limiting, and malformed data to ensure robust system behavior under adverse
          conditions.
      - area: Data Accuracy
        recommendation: Add criteria for validating the accuracy of normalized data
          against carrier-provided data to catch transformation errors.
      - area: Scalability
        recommendation: Define 'normal conditions' with concrete numbers (e.g., API
          call volume per hour) and include criteria for peak load scenarios to ensure
          system stability.

        feature: Automated Delay Alerts and Notifications
        description: A notification system that sends automated alerts to relevant
          users via email, SMS, or in-app notifications when a high-probability delay
          is predicted, ensuring timely awareness and response.
        current_acceptance_criteria:
        - Alerts are delivered within 5 minutes of a high-probability delay prediction.
        - System logs all sent notifications for audit purposes.
        testability_score: 6
        reason_for_score: The current criteria are partially testable with clear timing
          requirements and logging expectations. However, they lack specificity regarding
          notification types, user roles, failure scenarios, and content validation,
          which limits comprehensive testing.
      enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
      - Alerts are delivered to the correct user(s) via their preferred method (email,
        SMS, or in-app) within 5 minutes of a high-probability delay prediction.
      - Alert content includes specific delay details (e.g., reason, estimated delay
        duration, and affected process) and is consistent across notification methods.
      - System logs all sent notifications with timestamp, recipient, delivery method,
        and status (success/failed) for audit purposes.
      - Users receive a confirmation or error message if the notification fails to
        send due to invalid contact details or system errors.
      - Alerts are not sent for low-probability delay predictions (below defined threshold)
        to prevent notification fatigue.
      - System handles multiple simultaneous delay predictions by queuing notifications
        without duplication or loss.
      recommendations_for_improvement:
      - Define the threshold for 'high-probability delay prediction' (e.g., 80% likelihood)
        to make the trigger condition testable.
      - Specify user roles or groups eligible to receive notifications to ensure correct
        targeting.
      - Include requirements for notification content format and mandatory fields
        to validate consistency.
      - Add criteria for handling notification failures (e.g., retries, fallback methods)
        to cover error scenarios.
      - Clarify performance expectations for high-volume scenarios (e.g., maximum
        notifications per minute) to enable load testing.
      - Include accessibility requirements for notification content (e.g., readable
        by screen readers for in-app alerts).

      review:
        original_acceptance_criteria:
        - AI/ML model integrates seamlessly with GRIT via REST APIs.
        - Predictions are stored in a database for historical analysis and reporting.
        testability_score: 4
        reason_for_score: The current acceptance criteria are vague and lack specific,
          measurable outcomes. Terms like 'seamlessly' are subjective and not testable.
          There are no details on performance benchmarks, error handling, or accuracy
          metrics, which are critical for an AI/ML integration.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - Define specific API response times and success rates for integration (e.g.,
          99% uptime, <200ms response time).
        - Specify accuracy thresholds for predictions (e.g., prediction accuracy >80%).
        - Include criteria for error handling and fallback mechanisms if the model
          fails to predict or API is unavailable.
        - Detail database storage requirements (e.g., retention period, data format,
          query performance).
        - Add criteria for external data integration (weather, traffic) reliability
          and refresh frequency.
        - Include security requirements for API and data storage (e.g., encryption,
          authentication).
        - Define user-facing feedback or reporting mechanisms for predictions.
        enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
        - The AI/ML model integrates with GRIT via REST APIs, achieving a 99% success
          rate for API calls and response times under 200ms for 95% of requests under
          normal load (100 concurrent users).
        - The system returns delay predictions with an accuracy of at least 80%, validated
          against historical data over a 30-day period.
        - Predictions and associated metadata (e.g., timestamp, confidence score,
          input factors) are stored in the database with a retention period of at
          least 12 months.
        - Database queries for historical analysis return results in under 5 seconds
          for 95% of requests.
        - External data sources (weather, traffic) are updated at least every 6 hours,
          with fallback to cached data if updates fail, ensuring no prediction is
          based on data older than 24 hours.
        - API endpoints are secured with OAuth 2.0 authentication and data is encrypted
          in transit (TLS 1.2 or higher) and at rest (AES-256).
        - In case of model failure or API unavailability, the system displays a user-friendly
          error message and falls back to a default heuristic (e.g., historical average
          delay).
        - Users can view prediction reports in the GRIT UI, including delay likelihood,
          confidence score, and contributing factors, updated within 10 seconds of
          a new prediction.

      analysis:
        current_acceptance_criteria:
        - System integrates with external APIs for real-time traffic and weather data.
        - Route calculations complete within 5 seconds for 95% of requests.
        - Users can view and select from multiple route options in the interface.
        testability_score: 6
        reason_for_score: The current criteria provide a basic framework for testing
          but lack specificity in key areas such as error handling, data accuracy,
          user roles, and edge cases. Performance criteria are measurable, but integration
          and UI criteria are vague without defined success metrics or scenarios.
        enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
        - criterion: System successfully integrates with external APIs for real-time
            traffic and weather data.
          details: API calls return valid data with a success rate of at least 99%
            under normal conditions; system handles API failures gracefully with fallback
            data or cached results for up to 1 hour.
          testable_aspect: Verify API response codes, data format, and fallback behavior
            during outages.
        - criterion: Route calculations complete within 5 seconds for 95% of requests
            under typical load.
          details: Performance tested with a load of up to 1000 concurrent requests
            per minute; system logs calculation times for monitoring; average response
            time does not exceed 3 seconds.
          testable_aspect: Measure response times using automated performance testing
            tools and simulate varying loads.
        - criterion: Users can view and select from at least 3 distinct route options
            in the interface.
          details: Each route option displays estimated transit time, distance, and
            relevant constraints (e.g., weather hazards or traffic delays); selection
            updates delivery plan immediately; UI is responsive across desktop and
            mobile devices.
          testable_aspect: Validate UI rendering, data accuracy of route options,
            and responsiveness of selection action.
        - criterion: System recalculates routes dynamically when new traffic or weather
            data indicates a delay of more than 10 minutes on the current route.
          details: Recalculation triggers a notification to the user with updated
            route options; recalculation occurs without user intervention within 10
            seconds of data update.
          testable_aspect: Simulate data changes and verify recalculation timing and
            notification delivery.
        - criterion: System handles invalid or incomplete input data for route calculation.
          details: If delivery constraints (e.g., destination, vehicle type) are missing
            or invalid, system displays specific error messages to the user and logs
            the issue for debugging.
          testable_aspect: Test with malformed input data and verify error messaging
            and logging.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - area: Specificity in Integration
          recommendation: Define acceptable API response formats, latency thresholds,
            and error handling mechanisms (e.g., retry policies, caching) to ensure
            robust integration testing.
        - area: Performance Metrics
          recommendation: Expand performance criteria to include peak load scenarios
            (e.g., 5000 requests/minute) and define acceptable degradation thresholds
            for response times under stress.
        - area: User Experience
          recommendation: Add criteria for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 compliance) and
            multi-language support in the UI to ensure inclusivity and usability testing
            coverage.
        - area: Security
          recommendation: Include criteria for securing API communications (e.g.,
            HTTPS, API key validation) and protecting user data during route selection
            to enable security testing.

        - System calculates cost estimates with 90% accuracy based on historical data.
        - Users can override default cost parameters for specific shipments.
        - Interface displays clear cost vs. time comparisons for decision-making.
        enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
        - criterion: System calculates cost estimates with at least 90% accuracy when
            compared to historical data for similar routes and conditions.
          testability_note: Accuracy metric is defined and measurable through comparison
            with historical data; specify acceptable deviation range and sample size
            for testing.
        - criterion: Users with appropriate permissions can override default cost
            parameters (fuel cost per liter, toll fees, vehicle wear cost per km)
            for specific shipments, and the system recalculates the route cost accordingly.
          testability_note: Specific parameters and user roles are defined; testable
            through user role-based access and recalculation validation.
        - criterion: Interface displays a clear comparison of at least 3 route options,
            showing total cost (fuel, tolls, wear) and estimated delivery time for
            each, with the lowest cost route highlighted by default.
          testability_note: Specific UI elements and expected behavior (highlighting
            lowest cost) are defined; testable through UI validation and user interaction.
        - criterion: System updates cost estimates in real-time when external factors
            (e.g., traffic data, toll changes) are updated via integrated APIs.
          testability_note: Real-time update behavior is defined; testable through
            API integration and mock data for external changes.
        - criterion: System provides an error message or warning if cost data is unavailable
            or outdated (older than 24 hours) for a given route.
          testability_note: Error handling behavior is specified; testable through
            mock data scenarios with outdated or missing information.
        testability_score:
          original_score: 6
          enhanced_score: 9
          rationale: Original criteria lacked specificity in measurable outcomes (e.g.,
            what constitutes 'clear comparison'), error handling, and integration
            aspects. Enhanced criteria provide detailed, testable conditions and include
            additional scenarios like real-time updates and error handling.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - area: Accuracy Measurement
          recommendation: Define the exact method for calculating '90% accuracy' (e.g.,
            mean absolute percentage error) and specify the historical data sample
            size or timeframe for comparison.
        - area: User Permissions
          recommendation: Clarify which user roles can override parameters and ensure
            test cases cover unauthorized access attempts.
        - area: UI Specifications
          recommendation: Provide detailed UI mockups or wireframes to validate 'clear
            comparison' (e.g., font size, color contrast for accessibility, mobile
            responsiveness).
        - area: Integration Points
          recommendation: Document external data sources (e.g., traffic APIs, toll
            databases) and their expected update frequency to ensure test coverage
            for integration failures.

        description: A system that monitors shipments in transit and recommends route
          adjustments based on real-time disruptions like traffic jams or road closures,
          ensuring on-time delivery despite unexpected issues.
        enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
        - criterion: System detects disruptions within 10 minutes of occurrence for
            at least 90% of events across different disruption types (traffic jams,
            road closures, accidents).
          testability_notes: Specifies types of disruptions for clearer test scope
            and measurable detection rate.
        - criterion: Alerts are delivered to users within 30 seconds of disruption
            detection, with delivery confirmation logged for audit purposes.
          testability_notes: Adds delivery confirmation for verifiable testing of
            alert timing and receipt.
        - criterion: Users can configure notification preferences across multiple
            channels (email, SMS, in-app notifications) and select primary/secondary
            methods with a confirmation of settings saved.
          testability_notes: Specifies channel options and confirmation requirement
            for testing user configuration workflows.
        - criterion: System recommends at least one alternative route within 60 seconds
            of disruption detection, with the new route avoiding the identified disruption
            and maintaining estimated delivery time within 10% of original ETA if
            possible.
          testability_notes: Adds measurable criteria for route recommendation timing
            and quality of suggestion.
        - criterion: System logs all disruption events, alerts, and user interactions
            (e.g., accepting/rejecting route changes) for post-event analysis with
            timestamps accurate to the second.
          testability_notes: Ensures auditability and traceability of system actions
            and user responses for testing accuracy.
        testability_score:
          original_score: 6
          enhanced_score: 9
          reason: Original criteria lacked specificity in disruption types, measurable
            outcomes for route recommendations, and logging requirements. Enhanced
            criteria provide clearer metrics, scope, and verifiable outcomes, improving
            testability significantly. Score not 10 due to potential challenges in
            simulating real-time disruptions consistently for testing.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - area: Disruption Detection
          recommendation: Define specific disruption sources (e.g., third-party traffic
            APIs, weather services) and acceptable failure scenarios for the remaining
            10% of undetected events to allow targeted testing of detection accuracy.
        - area: Alert Delivery
          recommendation: Specify acceptable failure conditions for alert delivery
            (e.g., network outage) and fallback mechanisms (e.g., retry attempts)
            to ensure comprehensive error handling tests.
        - area: Route Recommendation
          recommendation: Include criteria for handling cases where no viable alternative
            route exists or when ETA deviation exceeds 10%, ensuring the system’s
            behavior is defined and testable.
        - area: User Experience
          recommendation: Add criteria for user acknowledgment of alerts/route changes
            (e.g., mandatory confirmation before route update) to test usability and
            interaction flows.
        missing_test_scenarios:
        - type: functional
          scenario: Testing system behavior when multiple disruptions occur simultaneously
            for the same shipment.
          reason: Current criteria do not address prioritization or handling of concurrent
            events, which is critical for real-world usage.
        - type: edge_case
          scenario: Testing disruption detection when data source (e.g., traffic API)
            is unavailable or returns delayed/inaccurate data.
          reason: Missing coverage for dependency failures which could impact detection
            within the 10-minute window.
        - type: performance
          scenario: Testing system scalability under high load (e.g., monitoring 10,000+
            shipments with frequent disruptions).
          reason: No criteria for system performance under stress, critical for ensuring
            timely detection and alerts.
        - type: security
          scenario: Testing for vulnerabilities in notification delivery (e.g., spoofing
            SMS/email alerts or intercepting in-app notifications).
          reason: Lack of security-related criteria for protecting sensitive shipment
            data and user communications.
        - type: usability
          scenario: Testing accessibility of notification preferences and route recommendation
            interfaces for users with disabilities (e.g., screen reader compatibility).
          reason: No mention of accessibility standards or user experience for diverse
            user needs.
        - type: integration
          scenario: Testing integration with external systems (e.g., traffic APIs,
            mapping services) for data accuracy and latency in route recommendations.
          reason: Missing explicit coverage for third-party dependencies which are
            core to system functionality.

        - Dashboard loads data within 3 seconds for standard queries under normal
          network conditions (defined as 10 Mbps or higher).
        - Analytics are updated daily by 6:00 AM UTC with historical data retained
          for a minimum of 12 months, accessible via date range filters.
        - Users can export reports in CSV or PDF format with file generation completed
          within 10 seconds for datasets up to 10,000 records.
        - Dashboard displays accurate on-time delivery rates, cost savings, and frequent
          disruptions for selected routes with data validated against source systems.
        - Users with 'Manager' role can access all route data, while 'Viewer' role
          can only access assigned routes.
        - Dashboard supports data visualization with interactive charts (e.g., bar,
          line) for key metrics, allowing drill-down to specific routes or time periods.
        - Error messages are displayed to users when data loading fails or export
          functionality encounters issues, with specific error codes for troubleshooting.
        testability_score:

            and interaction details, improving testability.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - area: Performance
          recommendation: Define 'standard queries' explicitly (e.g., number of records
            or complexity) to ensure consistent performance testing. Include scenarios
            for peak load conditions.
        - area: Data Retention
          recommendation: Specify how data older than 12 months is handled (e.g.,
            archived, deleted) and whether users are notified of data unavailability.
        - area: Export Functionality
          recommendation: Add criteria for handling large datasets during export (e.g.,
            timeout behavior, maximum file size) and format validation for CSV/PDF
            outputs.
        - area: User Experience
          recommendation: Include criteria for accessibility (e.g., WCAG 2.1 compliance)
            and mobile responsiveness to ensure usability across devices.
        - area: Security
          recommendation: Add criteria for data access controls and encryption of
            exported reports to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive analytics.

        ERP systems to ensure real-time inventory and order data consistency.
      acceptance_criteria_review:
        original_criteria:
        - Bidirectional sync between GRIT and ERP completes without data loss for
          inventory and orders.
        - Sync process handles at least 10,000 records per cycle with 99.9% accuracy.
        - Error logs are accessible to admins for diagnosing sync failures.
        enhanced_criteria:
        - Bidirectional sync between GRIT and ERP completes successfully without data
          loss for inventory and order records, validated by matching record counts
          and data integrity checks before and after sync.
        - Sync process handles at least 10,000 records per cycle with a minimum accuracy
          of 99.9%, measured by comparing synchronized data against source data within
          5 minutes of sync completion.
        - Error logs are accessible to admin users via the GRIT admin dashboard, containing
          detailed information including timestamp, error type, affected record ID,
          and resolution status for each sync failure.
        - Sync process resumes automatically after temporary connection failures between
          GRIT and ERP within 10 minutes, ensuring no manual intervention is required
          for transient issues.
        - Sync frequency can be configured by admins to occur at least every 15 minutes
          to maintain near real-time data consistency, with confirmation of successful
          configuration visible in the system settings.
        testability_score:
          original_score: 6
          enhanced_score: 9
          justification: Original criteria lacked specificity in measurable outcomes,
            timelines, and user access details. Enhanced criteria include specific
            validation methods, time constraints, and detailed error log expectations,
            making them more testable.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - Define acceptable latency for 'real-time' synchronization to set clear performance
          benchmarks (e.g., data updated within 5 minutes).
        - Specify supported ERP systems or versions to scope testing efforts and ensure
          compatibility validation.
        - Include criteria for handling duplicate records or conflicts during sync
          to address data integrity edge cases.
        - Add requirements for user notifications or alerts when sync failures occur,
          ensuring admins are proactively informed.
        - Clarify security requirements for data transmission (e.g., encryption standards)
          to ensure secure sync processes.

        description: Integrate GRIT with Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) to streamline
          warehouse operations by syncing inventory movements, pick-and-pack statuses,
          and storage locations. This feature ensures Operations Managers have real-time
          visibility into warehouse activities.
        original_acceptance_criteria:
        - WMS integration supports real-time updates for inventory movements and pick-and-pack
          statuses.
        - Sync process handles high-volume warehouse data (up to 5,000 updates/hour)
          without performance degradation.
        enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
        - criterion: WMS integration must support real-time updates for inventory
            movements, pick-and-pack statuses, and storage locations with a maximum
            latency of 5 seconds between WMS and GRIT systems.
          testable_aspect: Latency and data accuracy for real-time updates.
        - criterion: Sync process must handle high-volume warehouse data, processing
            at least 5,000 updates per hour, with system response time remaining under
            2 seconds per transaction and no data loss or duplication.
          testable_aspect: Performance under load, data integrity.
        - criterion: Integration must provide error notifications to Operations Managers
            via email or dashboard alerts within 60 seconds if sync fails or data
            discrepancies are detected between WMS and GRIT.
          testable_aspect: Error handling and notification timeliness.
        - criterion: WMS integration must support bidirectional data flow, allowing
            updates initiated from GRIT to reflect in WMS and vice versa, with data
            consistency maintained across both systems.
          testable_aspect: Bidirectional sync accuracy.
        - criterion: Integration must comply with data security standards, ensuring
            all data transferred between WMS and GRIT is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or
            higher, and access is restricted to authorized roles (e.g., Operations
            Managers).
          testable_aspect: Security and access control.
        testability_score:
          original_score: 4
          enhanced_score: 8
          reason_for_original_score: Original criteria lack specificity in measurable
            outcomes (e.g., latency, error handling) and miss critical aspects like
            security and bidirectional sync, making them difficult to test comprehensively.
          reason_for_enhanced_score: Enhanced criteria include specific, measurable
            targets (e.g., latency under 5 seconds, response time under 2 seconds)
            and cover broader aspects like security and error handling, improving
            testability. Score is not 10 due to potential need for further definition
            of edge cases and specific failure scenarios.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - recommendation: Define specific thresholds for 'real-time updates' (e.g.,
            maximum acceptable latency) to enable precise performance testing.
          impact: Improves ability to validate system behavior against clear benchmarks.
        - recommendation: Include detailed error handling scenarios, such as types
            of sync failures and expected recovery mechanisms, to ensure robust testing
            of failure modes.
          impact: Ensures system reliability under adverse conditions.
        - recommendation: Specify supported WMS platforms or protocols (e.g., API
            standards, data formats) to focus integration testing on compatibility.
          impact: Reduces ambiguity in integration scope and test design.
        - recommendation: Add criteria for handling peak load beyond 5,000 updates/hour
            to prepare for scalability testing.
          impact: Ensures system readiness for future growth or unexpected demand.
        - recommendation: Incorporate accessibility and usability criteria for Operations
            Managers interacting with the synced data (e.g., dashboard visibility,
            mobile access).
          impact: Improves end-user experience and adoption.

      description: Integrate GRIT with Transportation Management Systems (TMS) to
        provide real-time shipment tracking and delivery updates for Customer Service
        Representatives.
      acceptance_criteria_analysis:
        current_criteria:
        - TMS integration provides accurate shipment statuses and ETAs with minimal
          latency.
        - System supports syncing for at least 1,000 shipments per hour.
        enhanced_criteria:
        - TMS integration must provide shipment status updates (e.g., In Transit,
          Delayed, Delivered) and ETAs within 5 seconds of a status change in the
          TMS, with 99.9% accuracy across all tracked shipments.
        - System must support syncing of shipment data for at least 1,000 shipments
          per hour during peak load, with no more than 1% data loss or sync failures.
        - Customer Service Representatives must be able to view real-time shipment
          status and ETA for any shipment via the GRIT dashboard without requiring
          manual refresh.
        - System must log and display integration errors (e.g., connection failures,
          data mismatches) to administrators with timestamps and error codes for troubleshooting.
        - TMS integration must handle invalid or incomplete data from the TMS by displaying
          a fallback status (e.g., 'Status Unavailable') to users and logging the
          issue for admins.
        testability_score:
          current_score: 4
          reason: Current criteria lack specificity (e.g., 'minimal latency' is vague,
            no measurable threshold provided) and do not cover error handling, user
            experience, or edge cases. This makes it difficult to design precise test
            cases or validate outcomes.
          enhanced_score: 8
          enhanced_reason: Enhanced criteria include measurable thresholds (e.g.,
            5 seconds latency, 99.9% accuracy, 1,000 shipments/hour), user-specific
            outcomes, and error handling scenarios, improving testability. However,
            further clarification on TMS vendor-specific behaviors or API constraints
            could elevate this to a 9 or 10.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - Define specific latency thresholds and accuracy percentages for shipment
          status updates to enable precise pass/fail criteria in testing.
        - Include user role-specific criteria (e.g., what Customer Service Representatives
          should see and do with the data).
        - Add criteria for error handling, such as how the system behaves during TMS
          downtime or data inconsistencies.
        - Specify supported TMS vendors or API standards to ensure compatibility testing
          is scoped appropriately.
        - Include security requirements, such as authentication and data encryption
          between GRIT and TMS, to address potential vulnerabilities.

      feature: Integration Hub Dashboard and Monitoring
      description: Provide a centralized dashboard within GRIT to monitor the health
        and status of all integrations (ERP, WMS, TMS). This feature enables IT admins
        and Logistics Managers to quickly identify and resolve integration issues,
        ensuring uninterrupted data flow.
      acceptance_criteria_review:
        current_criteria:
        - Dashboard displays accurate, real-time status for all configured integrations.
        - Alerts are triggered reliably for integration failures with configurable
          settings.
        enhanced_criteria:
        - Dashboard displays accurate, real-time status (e.g., 'Connected', 'Disconnected',
          'Error') for all configured integrations (ERP, WMS, TMS) with a refresh
          rate of no more than 5 seconds.
        - Alerts are triggered within 10 seconds of detecting integration failures,
          with configurable settings for alert thresholds (e.g., retry count, timeout
          duration) and notification methods (e.g., email, in-app).
        - Dashboard provides historical data of integration status for the past 24
          hours, accessible via a collapsible timeline or chart.
        - Users with roles 'IT Admin' and 'Logistics Manager' can view and interact
          with the dashboard, while unauthorized users receive an access denied error.
        - Alerts include detailed error information (e.g., error code, timestamp,
          affected integration) and a link to troubleshooting documentation or logs.
        - Dashboard supports filtering and sorting of integrations by status, type,
          or last updated time for easier issue identification.
        testability_score:
          current_score: 4
          enhanced_score: 8
          rationale: The original criteria lack specificity in terms of measurable
            outcomes (e.g., refresh rate, alert timing), user roles, and detailed
            error handling. The enhanced criteria provide clear, testable metrics
            and scenarios, improving testability significantly. However, some aspects
            like performance under high load still need detailed benchmarks.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - Define specific performance benchmarks for dashboard load times and alert
          delivery under varying system loads (e.g., 100 vs. 10,000 transactions).
        - Specify acceptable error margins for 'real-time' status updates (e.g., allowable
          delay in seconds).
        - Include criteria for accessibility compliance (e.g., WCAG 2.1 Level AA)
          to ensure the dashboard is usable by all relevant staff.
        - Add criteria for handling edge cases, such as behavior when integrations
          are partially available or when the dashboard itself loses connectivity.
        - Clarify data retention policies for historical data (e.g., how long data
          is stored, how it can be accessed or exported).

        setting up and managing integrations with ERP, WMS, and TMS systems, allowing
        IT Admins to onboard new systems and adjust sync settings without developer
        intervention.
      acceptance_criteria_analysis:
        current_criteria:
        - Configuration interface supports onboarding for ERP, WMS, and TMS with guided
          setup.
        - System validates all configurations before activation to prevent sync errors.
        enhanced_criteria:
        - The configuration interface shall provide a guided setup wizard for onboarding
          ERP, WMS, and TMS systems, including step-by-step instructions and visual
          feedback for each step.
        - The system shall validate all integration configurations (e.g., API keys,
          endpoints, authentication credentials) before activation, displaying specific
          error messages for each failed validation.
        - The interface shall allow IT Admins to modify existing sync settings (e.g.,
          frequency, data fields) for active integrations without requiring system
          downtime.
        - The system shall log all configuration changes and validation results for
          audit purposes, accessible only to authorized IT Admin roles.
        - The onboarding process shall complete within 10 minutes under normal conditions
          for a single system integration with valid credentials.
        - The interface shall support rollback or cancellation of onboarding at any
          step before final activation without affecting existing integrations.
        testability_score:
          current_score: 4
          enhanced_score: 8
          reason: Current criteria are vague and lack specific, measurable outcomes.
            Enhanced criteria add specificity (e.g., error messages, time constraints,
            rollback support) and cover more functional aspects, making them more
            testable.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - Define specific validation rules for configurations (e.g., format of API
          keys, required fields).
        - Include performance benchmarks for onboarding and configuration updates
          (e.g., max time for validation).
        - Specify accessibility requirements for the interface (e.g., WCAG 2.1 compliance).
        - Clarify supported integration versions or protocols for ERP, WMS, and TMS
          systems.
        - Add criteria for handling failed validations or onboarding attempts, including
          user notifications and recovery options.

        exceptions such as delays, damages, or route deviations by monitoring real-time
        data against predefined thresholds.
      current_acceptance_criteria:
      - System detects and flags at least 95% of exceptions based on predefined rules.
      - All exceptions are logged with relevant details for audit purposes.
      - Notifications are sent within 5 minutes of exception detection.
      analysis:
        testability_score: 6
        reason_for_score: The current acceptance criteria provide a high-level overview
          of expected functionality but lack specificity in measurable outcomes, edge
          cases, and error handling. Key details such as types of exceptions, logging
          formats, and notification recipients are undefined, making comprehensive
          testing challenging.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - Specify the types of exceptions (e.g., delay, damage, route deviation) and
          associated predefined rules for detection to ensure consistent test coverage.
        - Define 'relevant details' for logging (e.g., timestamp, exception type,
          shipment ID, severity) to make audit logging testable.
        - Clarify notification requirements (e.g., recipient roles, delivery channels
          like email/SMS, content format) and acceptable latency thresholds under
          varying conditions.
        - Include criteria for false positive handling and exception resolution workflows
          to cover end-to-end functionality.
        - Add performance benchmarks for system scalability under high exception volumes
          to ensure reliability.
        - Define accessibility and usability requirements for exception visibility
          in the user interface.
        enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
        - System detects and flags at least 95% of shipment exceptions (delays > 2
          hours, damages reported via sensor data, route deviations > 5 miles) based
          on predefined rules, verified through simulated test data.
        - All detected exceptions are logged in the audit trail with specific details
          including timestamp (UTC), exception type, shipment ID, severity level,
          and triggering rule, retrievable for at least 90 days.
        - Notifications for critical exceptions are sent to designated roles (e.g.,
          logistics manager) via email and SMS within 5 minutes of detection, with
          a delivery success rate of at least 98%.
        - System identifies and flags false positives with a rate of less than 2%,
          allowing users to mark and resolve them manually.
        - System maintains detection accuracy and notification delivery under peak
          load (e.g., 100 exceptions per minute) with response time degradation of
          no more than 10%.
        - Exception dashboard in the UI displays flagged exceptions in real-time,
          with filtering options by type, severity, and status, compliant with WCAG
          2.1 Level AA for accessibility.

        - criterion: All detected exceptions must be categorized into predefined severity
            levels (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) within 2 minutes of detection,
            with a system timestamp confirming the categorization time.
          testability_note: Adds specificity with severity levels and measurable timestamp
            validation.
        - criterion: Prioritization rules must be applied consistently based on predefined
            configurations for all exception types, with system logs reflecting the
            rule applied for each exception.
          testability_note: Adds traceability through logs for consistency validation.
        - criterion: Users with appropriate permissions must be able to override system-assigned
            priorities, with the override action logged and a confirmation message
            displayed within 5 seconds of submission.
          testability_note: Specifies permission requirements, logging, UI feedback,

          reasoning: Original criteria lacked specificity in measurable outcomes (e.g.,
            severity levels, response times for overrides, performance benchmarks)
            and missed critical aspects like notifications and permissions. Enhanced
            criteria add clear, testable metrics and cover broader scenarios, improving
            testability significantly.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - area: Specificity
          recommendation: Define exact severity levels and associated prioritization
            rules in the criteria to ensure consistent testing (e.g., Critical = immediate
            action, Low = deferred).
        - area: Performance
          recommendation: Include criteria for system behavior under load (e.g., exception
            categorization during peak traffic) to validate scalability.
        - area: User Experience
          recommendation: Add criteria for user feedback mechanisms (e.g., confirmation
            messages, error handling during overrides) to ensure usability.
        - area: Security
          recommendation: Specify which user roles can override priorities to prevent
            unauthorized access and ensure permission-based testing.

        description: This feature automates the escalation of critical exceptions
          to predefined stakeholders or teams based on severity and type, ensuring
          rapid response to high-impact issues.
        current_acceptance_criteria:
        - Escalations occur within 5 minutes of meeting criteria for critical exceptions.
        - All escalations are logged with timestamps and recipient details.
        - System prevents duplicate escalations for the same issue.
        testability_score: 6
        analysis: The current acceptance criteria provide a basic framework for testing
          but lack specificity in several areas, such as defining 'critical exceptions,'
          escalation channels, failure scenarios, and recovery mechanisms. The criteria
          are measurable but incomplete for ensuring comprehensive test coverage.
      enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
      - Escalations for critical exceptions (defined as severity level 1 or 2) must
        be initiated within 5 minutes of detection.
      - Escalations must be sent via predefined channels (e.g., email, SMS, or internal
        messaging) based on exception type and stakeholder role.
      - All escalations must be logged in the system with timestamps (in UTC), recipient
        details (name and contact), exception ID, and delivery status (sent/failed).
      - System must prevent duplicate escalations for the same exception ID within
        a 30-minute window unless manually overridden by an admin.
      - If an escalation fails to deliver (e.g., invalid contact or network issue),
        the system must retry up to 3 times at 1-minute intervals and log each attempt.
      - Stakeholders must receive a clear message with exception details (type, severity,
        time of occurrence, and initial action required).
      - System must allow configuration of escalation rules (severity thresholds,
        recipient groups) by admin users only.
      - An audit trail must be maintained for all escalation rule changes, including
        who made the change and when.
      recommendations_for_improvement:
      - aspect: Specificity of Critical Exceptions
        recommendation: Define severity levels and types of exceptions that trigger
          escalations to ensure consistent testing (e.g., database failure as severity
          1, API timeout as severity 2).
      - aspect: Escalation Channels
        recommendation: Specify supported communication channels and their priority
          order for escalations to test channel-specific behaviors and fallbacks.
      - aspect: Error Handling
        recommendation: Include criteria for handling failed escalations, retries,
          and fallback mechanisms to ensure robustness under adverse conditions.
      - aspect: User Roles and Permissions
        recommendation: Clarify which user roles can configure or override escalation
          rules to test access control and prevent unauthorized changes.
      - aspect: Performance Metrics
        recommendation: Add acceptable thresholds for system performance under high
          load (e.g., 100 escalations per minute) to validate scalability.

      - area: Performance
        recommendation: Include scenarios for datasets beyond 10,000 exceptions to
          test scalability and define expected behavior for timeouts or failures.
      - area: Audit Logging
        recommendation: Specify log retention period, format, and access permissions
          to ensure security and compliance testing can be conducted.
      - area: User Experience
        recommendation: Add criteria for user notifications and UI feedback to cover
          the end-to-end user journey.
      - area: Accessibility

        feature: Mobile Shipment Tracking Overview
        description: Provides logistics managers and coordinators with a mobile-optimized
          view of all active shipments, including status, location, and estimated
          delivery times, enabling real-time decision-making and issue resolution
          from any location.
        current_acceptance_criteria:
        - Mobile shipment overview loads in under 3 seconds on standard network conditions.
        - Shipment data refreshes automatically every 30 seconds or on manual pull-to-refresh.
        testability_score: 6
        analysis: The current acceptance criteria provide a basic framework for performance
          and functionality testing but lack specificity in several areas, such as
          defining 'standard network conditions,' handling error states, and addressing
          usability or accessibility. Additionally, they miss critical scenarios like
          offline behavior, data accuracy, and user interaction flows.
      enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
      - criterion: Mobile shipment overview loads in under 3 seconds on 4G or Wi-Fi
          network conditions with at least 5 Mbps download speed.
        rationale: Specifies network conditions for consistent performance testing.
      - criterion: Shipment data refreshes automatically every 30 seconds when the
          app is in the foreground, with a visual indicator showing the last refresh
          time.
        rationale: Adds clarity on app state and user feedback for refresh timing.
      - criterion: Manual pull-to-refresh updates shipment data within 2 seconds under
          normal network conditions, displaying a success or error message.
        rationale: Covers user-initiated refresh and error handling.
      - criterion: Shipment overview displays accurate data including status, current
          location (within 100 meters accuracy), and estimated delivery time (updated
          within last 5 minutes) for all active shipments.
        rationale: Ensures data accuracy and relevance, critical for decision-making.
      - criterion: App remains usable offline by displaying the last cached shipment
          data with a clear 'Offline Mode' indicator.
        rationale: Addresses offline functionality, critical for mobile logistics
          use.
      - criterion: UI is mobile-optimized, supporting screen sizes from 4.7 to 6.7
          inches, with legible text (minimum 14px) and touch targets at least 44x44
          pixels.
        rationale: Ensures usability and accessibility on various mobile devices.
      - criterion: App provides error notifications for failed data refreshes, including
          network errors or server timeouts, with a retry option.
        rationale: Covers error handling and user recovery options.
      recommendations_for_improvement:
      - area: Performance Testing
        recommendation: Define specific network conditions and device specifications
          for load time testing to ensure repeatability. Include tests for weaker
          network conditions (e.g., 3G or poor signal).
      - area: Error Handling
        recommendation: Add criteria for handling edge cases such as server downtime,
          no active shipments, or GPS inaccuracies to ensure robust error messaging
          and fallback behavior.
      - area: Usability and Accessibility
        recommendation: Incorporate WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance requirements to ensure
          the app is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., screen reader support,
          color contrast ratios).
      - area: Security
        recommendation: Include criteria for data encryption during transmission and
          at rest, as well as authentication checks to prevent unauthorized access
          to shipment data.

        enhanced_criteria:
        - Notifications for critical shipment issues (delays, exceptions) must be
          delivered to the user's mobile device within 10 seconds of issue detection,
          verifiable through timestamp logs.
        - Users can configure notification preferences in the settings menu, including
          options to enable/disable specific alert types (e.g., delays, exceptions)
          and set severity levels (e.g., low, medium, high), with changes applied
          immediately after saving.
        - Notifications must display relevant shipment details (e.g., shipment ID,
          issue type, timestamp) in both push and in-app formats.
        - Notifications must support acknowledgment by the user, with a record of
          acknowledgment stored in the system for audit purposes.
        - The system must prevent duplicate notifications for the same issue within
          a 5-minute window, unless the issue severity escalates.
        testability_score:
          current_score: 6
          reason: The original criteria lack specificity in terms of measurable outcomes,
            user interaction details, and edge case handling. The delivery time is
            testable, but 'configure notification preferences' is vague without details
            on what can be configured and expected behavior.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - Define specific alert types and severity levels to ensure consistent testing
          (e.g., delay alerts for >30 minutes as 'high severity').
        - Specify the format and content of notifications (e.g., must include shipment
          ID, issue type) to validate user experience.
        - Add criteria for handling edge cases, such as network failures or duplicate
          notifications, to ensure robust system behavior.
        - Include accessibility requirements for notifications (e.g., support for
          screen readers, high-contrast mode).
        - Clarify expected behavior when the user is offline or the device is in 'Do
          Not Disturb' mode.

        - Quick action buttons (e.g., 'Re-route Shipment', 'Escalate Issue') are accessible
          within two taps from the shipment details screen on the mobile dashboard.
        - Each quick action, when triggered, completes the intended operation (e.g.,
          re-routing or escalation) and displays a confirmation message to the user
          within 3 seconds under normal network conditions.
        - All quick actions are logged in the system with a timestamp, user ID, action
          type, and shipment ID for traceability and compliance, retrievable via the
          audit log within 24 hours.
        - Quick action buttons are only visible and actionable to users with appropriate
          permissions (e.g., logistics coordinators).
        - Quick actions are disabled or display an appropriate error message when
          the shipment is in a state that does not allow the action (e.g., shipment
          already delivered).
        - Quick action buttons are responsive and functional across different screen
          sizes and orientations on supported mobile devices.

        - All metrics are accurate and updated daily based on shipment data.
        testability_score: 5
        analysis:
          strengths:
          - Performance criterion (load time) is specific and measurable.
          - Data scope (10 carriers, 12 months) is clearly defined.
          weaknesses:
          - Accuracy of metrics lacks specific validation criteria or benchmarks.
          - No mention of error handling, user roles, or edge cases.
          - Daily update criterion lacks detail on timing or failure scenarios.
          - Missing UI/UX, accessibility, and security considerations.
          - No criteria for SLA comparison or visual representation of data.
        enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
        - Dashboard loads within 3 seconds for up to 10 carriers with 12 months of
          data under normal network conditions (average latency < 100ms).
        - Dashboard displays accurate on-time delivery rates, transit times, and exception
          rates, validated against raw shipment data with a tolerance of ±0.5% for
          each metric.
        - Metrics are updated daily by 2:00 AM UTC, with a failure notification sent
          to admins if the update process fails.
        - Dashboard supports at least 3 user roles (Admin, Manager, Viewer) with appropriate
          data access restrictions.
        - UI displays metrics in both tabular and graphical formats, with color-coded
          SLA compliance indicators (green for met, red for breached).
        - Dashboard handles error states gracefully, displaying meaningful messages
          for data unavailability or loading failures.
        - Dashboard is accessible per WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, including keyboard
          navigation and screen reader support.
        - Dashboard prevents unauthorized access and protects sensitive carrier data
          per defined security policies.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - Define specific benchmarks or formulas for metric accuracy (e.g., how on-time
          delivery rate is calculated).
        - Specify acceptable error margins or tolerances for performance metrics.
        - Include criteria for handling larger datasets (beyond 10 carriers or 12
          months) to test scalability.
        - Add requirements for user interaction (e.g., filtering, sorting, or exporting
          data).
        - Clarify expected behavior for edge cases like no data, partial data, or
          system downtime.
        - Incorporate security and data privacy requirements to address potential
          risks.
        - Detail expectations for mobile responsiveness or cross-browser compatibility.

        - SLA compliance data is updated daily and reflects accurate shipment outcomes.
        - Alerts are delivered within 5 minutes of a detected violation.
        enhanced_criteria:
        - SLA compliance data must be updated daily by 2:00 AM UTC, reflecting accurate
          shipment outcomes for all carriers, with a data accuracy rate of at least
          99.5% when compared to source shipment records.
        - Alerts for SLA violations must be delivered to designated users via email
          and in-app notifications within 5 minutes of detection, with a delivery
          success rate of at least 98%.
        - Detailed SLA violation reports must be accessible on-demand, covering a
          selectable date range of up to 12 months, and exportable in PDF and CSV
          formats.
        - System must log all SLA violations with timestamp, carrier details, violation
          type, and affected shipment IDs for audit purposes.
        - Alerts must include actionable details such as carrier name, violation type,
          shipment ID, and a link to the detailed report.
        testability_score:
          current_score: 5
          reason: Current criteria lack specificity in terms of timing, accuracy metrics,
            delivery methods, and report details, making it difficult to design precise
            test cases or validate outcomes comprehensively.
          enhanced_score: 8
          enhanced_reason: Enhanced criteria provide measurable thresholds (e.g.,
            99.5% accuracy, 5-minute delivery), specific timings (2:00 AM UTC), and
            detailed requirements for alerts and reports, improving testability. However,
            some aspects like user roles/permissions and edge cases for data updates
            still need clarification.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - Define specific user roles or permissions for accessing SLA reports and
          receiving alerts to enable role-based testing.
        - Specify the expected behavior when data updates fail or are delayed (e.g.,
          fallback mechanisms or error notifications).
        - Clarify the volume of data or number of carriers the system must handle
          to support performance testing scenarios.
        - Include requirements for handling historical data corrections or retroactive
          SLA updates for accurate reporting.
        - Define accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1 Level AA) for alerts and
          reports to ensure usability testing coverage.

        feature: Industry Benchmarking Reports
        description: Generate reports that benchmark carrier performance against industry
          standards and anonymized peer data, helping procurement teams negotiate
          better contracts and set realistic performance expectations.
        original_acceptance_criteria:
        - Benchmark data is updated quarterly based on industry feeds or internal
          data aggregation.
        - Reports maintain data anonymity and comply with privacy regulations.
        enhanced_acceptance_criteria:
        - Benchmark data must be updated quarterly, with the update process completing
          within 24 hours of receiving new industry feeds or internal data aggregation,
          and a confirmation log entry must be created.
        - Reports must mask or aggregate data to ensure anonymity, preventing identification
          of individual carriers or peers by displaying data only in grouped formats
          (e.g., averages, percentiles) with a minimum group size of 5 entities.
        - Reports must comply with GDPR and other applicable privacy regulations,
          with a compliance audit trail available for review.
        - Users with appropriate permissions (e.g., procurement team roles) must be
          able to generate a benchmarking report on-demand within 10 seconds for datasets
          up to 10,000 records.
        - Reports must include visual comparisons (e.g., charts, graphs) of carrier
          performance against industry averages and peer percentiles, with export
          options in PDF and CSV formats.
        - System must notify users via email or dashboard alert if benchmark data
          is outdated (older than 90 days) when generating a report.
        testability_score:
          original_score: 4
          enhanced_score: 8
          reasoning: Original criteria lacked specificity, measurable outcomes, and
            user interaction details, making them difficult to test comprehensively.
            Enhanced criteria include specific timeframes, performance benchmarks,
            compliance requirements, and user experience expectations, improving testability.
        recommendations_for_improvement:
        - area: Specificity
          recommendation: Define exact data update schedules (e.g., first day of each
            quarter) and acceptable completion times to enable precise validation.
        - area: Compliance
          recommendation: Specify which privacy regulations apply based on user location
            or data origin to create targeted test scenarios for GDPR, CCPA, etc.
        - area: Performance
          recommendation: Include benchmarks for report generation times under various
            data load conditions to ensure scalability testing.
        - area: User Experience
          recommendation: Add criteria for accessibility (e.g., WCAG 2.1 compliance)
            to ensure reports are usable by all procurement team members.

        - Users must receive a clear error message if the total weight of metrics
          does not equal 100% upon saving a scorecard.
        - Scorecards must allow saving and retrieval of custom configurations for
          reuse across multiple carriers or time periods.
        - The system must validate metric inputs to prevent invalid data (e.g., negative
          weights, non-numeric values) and provide specific error feedback.
        - Scorecards must be accessible to users with appropriate permissions only,

            and KPI values to ensure consistent test scenarios for invalid inputs.
        - area: Performance
          recommendation: Specify performance expectations under varying loads (e.g.,
            score recalculation time for 1 vs. 1000 carriers) to cover scalability
            testing.
        - area: User Experience
          recommendation: Add criteria for usability, such as intuitive UI feedback
            during scorecard creation and modification, to ensure user satisfaction.
        - area: Accessibility
          recommendation: Include compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards to ensure

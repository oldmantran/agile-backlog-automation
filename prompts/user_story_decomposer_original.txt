You are a user story expert. Convert the given feature into 3-6 user stories for ${domain} projects.

RESPONSE FORMAT: ONLY valid JSON array. NO text, explanations, or markdown.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS: 
- Each user story MUST have EXACTLY 3-5 acceptance criteria (MINIMUM: 3, MAXIMUM: 5)
- Stories with fewer than 3 criteria will be REJECTED
- Each criterion must be unique and test different aspects
- AVOID OVER-DECOMPOSITION: Don't split closely related functionality into separate stories
- Each story should represent a complete, valuable piece of functionality for the user
- Stories should be INDEPENDENT and deliverable separately

CONTEXT:
- Project: ${project_name}
- Domain: ${domain}
- Platform: ${platform}

PRODUCT VISION:
${product_vision}

PARENT EPIC CONTEXT:
${epic_context}

REQUIRED FIELDS per story:
- title: A concise summary of the user story (max 60 chars) - e.g., "User Login Authentication" or "Dashboard Analytics View"
- user_story: The complete user story format "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
- description: Start with the full user story, then provide detailed functionality explanation, implementation requirements, and business context
- acceptance_criteria: Array of exactly 3-5 testable conditions using "Given/When/Then" format (REQUIRED: minimum 3, maximum 5)
  CRITICAL: These are acceptance criteria WITHIN ONE story, NOT separate user stories
- story_points: Use Fibonacci (1,2,3,5,8,13): 1=simple change, 3=medium feature, 5=complex feature, 8=large feature
- priority: "High", "Medium", or "Low"
- category: "authentication", "data_management", "ui_ux", "integration", "security", "performance", or "administration"
- user_type: "new_user", "existing_user", "admin", "power_user", or "casual_user"

IMPORTANT: Each story MUST have 3-5 acceptance criteria. Generate EXACTLY that many.

RESPOND WITH ONLY A JSON ARRAY OF USER STORIES. Use these fields for each story:
- title: Concise summary (max 60 chars) - NOT the full user story  
- user_story: Complete "As a [role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
- description: Start with full user story, then detailed functionality explanation
- acceptance_criteria: Array of 3-5 "Given/When/Then" test scenarios
- story_points: Fibonacci number (1,2,3,5,8,13)
- priority: "High", "Medium", or "Low"
- category: Choose appropriate category
- user_type: Choose appropriate user type

DO NOT RETURN TEMPLATE PLACEHOLDERS. Generate actual, specific content based on the feature being decomposed.

### Domain-Specific User Story Guidelines for "${domain}":
- User stories MUST reflect actual roles and personas from the domain
- Acceptance criteria should test real business scenarios, not generic system behavior
- Use industry-specific terminology in stories and criteria
- Reference actual workflows, processes, and outcomes from the domain
- Consider domain-specific regulations, standards, and best practices

## CRITICAL: Acceptance Criteria Format

CORRECT Example:
{
  "title": "Asset Health Alert Dashboard",
  "user_story": "As a warehouse manager, I want to view asset health alerts so that I can schedule proactive maintenance",
  "description": "As a warehouse manager, I want to view asset health alerts so that I can schedule proactive maintenance. This feature provides real-time visibility into dock asset health status through a centralized dashboard interface. Warehouse managers can view anomaly alerts, track asset conditions, and prioritize maintenance activities based on severity and impact.",
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "Given a dock asset has a detected anomaly, When I access the dashboard, Then I see the alert with asset details",
    "Given multiple alerts exist, When I view the alert list, Then they are sorted by priority and timestamp", 
    "Given an alert is acknowledged, When I mark it as reviewed, Then it moves to the reviewed section"
  ]
}

WRONG - DO NOT DO THIS:
Do NOT create separate stories like:
- "Given a dock asset has a detected anomaly"
- "When I access the dashboard" 
- "Then I see the alert with asset details"

These are acceptance criteria components, NOT individual user stories!

Note: The acceptance_criteria array MUST contain 3-5 complete Given/When/Then statements. No more, no less.

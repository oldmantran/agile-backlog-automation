- **DevOps & CI/CD**: Automated testing, deployment, and monitoring
- **Code Quality**: Best practices in ${tech_stack} development
- **Performance Optimization**: Scalability and efficiency considerations

## Current Context:
- **Project**: ${project_name}
- **Technology Stack**: ${tech_stack}
- **Architecture Pattern**: ${architecture_pattern}
- **Database**: ${database_type}
- **Cloud Platform**: ${cloud_platform}
- **Team Size**: ${team_size}
- **Sprint Duration**: ${sprint_duration}

## CRITICAL RESPONSE FORMAT:
You MUST respond with ONLY a valid JSON array. No markdown, no explanations, no additional text.

## Task Breakdown Guidelines:

### Structure Requirements:
Each task must include:
1. **title**: Clear, implementation-focused task name (max 100 characters)
2. **description**: Detailed technical implementation requirements
3. **estimated_hours**: Realistic time estimate (1-8 hours per task)
4. **category**: frontend|backend|database|testing|devops|documentation
5. **priority**: High|Medium|Low based on dependencies and risk
6. **acceptance_criteria**: Array of specific technical completion criteria

### Best Practices:
- Create **appropriately sized tasks** per user story based on complexity
- Ensure tasks are **appropriately sized** (1-8 hours each)
- Include **testing tasks** for quality assurance
- Consider **documentation** and **code review** requirements
- Address **security**, **performance**, and **accessibility** concerns
- Plan for **error handling** and **logging**

## Task Categories to Include:

### Core Development:
- **frontend**: UI implementation and user interaction
- **backend**: Business logic and data processing
- **database**: Schema, queries, and data migration

### Quality & Testing:
- **testing**: Unit, integration, and UI testing

### DevOps & Infrastructure:
- **devops**: CI/CD, deployment, monitoring, security

## REQUIRED JSON STRUCTURE:
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Task title",
    "description": "Detailed task description",
    "estimated_hours": 4,
    "category": "frontend|backend|database|testing|devops|documentation",
    "priority": "High|Medium|Low",
    "acceptance_criteria": ["Criteria 1", "Criteria 2", "Criteria 3"]
  }
]
```

## Estimation Guidelines:
- **1-2 hours**: Simple component updates, minor bug fixes
- **2-4 hours**: New component creation, API endpoint implementation  
- **4-8 hours**: Complex feature implementation, integration work

## Quality Checklist:
✅ Tasks are appropriately sized for sprint planning
✅ Testing tasks are included for quality assurance
✅ Security and performance considerations are addressed
✅ Error handling and edge cases are considered
✅ Acceptance criteria are specific and measurable

## CRITICAL: Respond with ONLY the JSON array. No markdown formatting, no code blocks, no explanations.

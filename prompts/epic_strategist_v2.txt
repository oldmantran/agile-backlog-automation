EXAMPLE EPIC (your output must match this structure exactly):
[
  {
    "title": "One-Tap Ride Request & Real-Time Dispatch",
    "description": "Enable Urban Commuters and College Students to request autonomous vehicles with single tap, achieving <45s dispatch through cloud-based fleet optimization and real-time vehicle tracking on mobile platforms.",

✓ Title ≤60 chars using EXACT terms from vision
✓ References specific product name from vision
✓ Names target users (e.g., Urban Commuter, not "users")
✓ Includes platform (mobile, iOS, web, etc.) from vision
✓ Ties to measurable outcome (e.g., <45s dispatch, 90% coverage)
✓ Uses domain terms (e.g., autonomous vehicle, ride-hailing, fleet)
✓ Valid JSON with all required fields

EPIC STRUCTURE:
- title: Specific capability from vision (max 60 chars)
- description: WHO uses it, WHAT it does, HOW it delivers value (2-3 sentences)
- priority: High|Medium|Low based on vision emphasis
- estimated_complexity: XS|S|M|L|XL
- category: core_platform|user_experience|data_management|integration|security|performance|administration

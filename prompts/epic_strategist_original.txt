3. **priority**: High|Medium|Low based on vision's business impact
4. **estimated_complexity**: XS|S|M|L|XL
5. **category**: core_platform|user_experience|data_management|integration|security|performance|administration

### Epic Categories (Choose Most Appropriate):
- **core_platform**: Fundamental capabilities mentioned in vision
- **user_experience**: User workflows and interfaces described in vision
- **data_management**: Data processing and analytics from vision
- **integration**: External connections required by vision
- **security**: Protection requirements in vision
- **performance**: Speed/reliability goals from vision  
- **administration**: Operational tools needed for vision

## EXCELLENCE EXAMPLES:

❌ **POOR (will score <70)**:

RESPONSE FORMAT: ONLY valid JSON array. NO text, explanations, or markdown.

PRODUCT VISION:
${product_vision}

CONTEXT:
- Project: ${project_name}
- Domain: ${domain}
- Target Users: ${target_users}
- Timeline: ${timeline}
- Budget: ${budget_constraints}

## Epic Creation Guidelines:

### CRITICAL: Base ALL epics on the PRODUCT VISION above
- Every epic MUST directly support achieving the vision stated above
- Epic titles MUST contain specific terminology from the vision (NOT generic terms)
- Consider the specific target audience, business objectives, and KPIs mentioned
- Do NOT create generic work items - tailor everything to the vision's domain and goals
- FORBIDDEN: Generic titles like "System", "Platform", "Management", "Tracking" without vision context

### Structure Requirements:
Each epic must include:
1. **title**: Clear, action-oriented name (max 60 characters) 
2. **description**: Comprehensive 2-3 sentence description that directly relates to the vision
3. **priority**: High|Medium|Low based on business impact to the vision
4. **estimated_complexity**: XS|S|M|L|XL (t-shirt sizing)
5. **category**: core_platform|user_experience|data_management|integration|security|performance|administration

### Best Practices:
- Create **${max_epics} epics** that together deliver the complete vision
- Each epic should directly address specific aspects of the product vision
- Ensure epics are **independent** where possible
- Focus on **user outcomes** mentioned in the vision rather than technical implementation
- Consider **MVP delivery** for early value realization
- Balance **business value** with **technical feasibility**

## Epic Categories to Consider:
- **core_platform**: Fundamental platform capabilities and infrastructure
- **user_experience**: User interface, workflows, and interaction design
- **data_management**: Data storage, processing, and analytics
- **integration**: External system connections and APIs
- **security**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **performance**: Speed, reliability, and scalability
- **administration**: Configuration, management, and operational tools

## REQUIRED JSON STRUCTURE:
[
  {
    "title": "Specific Epic Name Based on Vision (max 60 chars)",
    "description": "2-3 sentences directly addressing vision requirements and target audience needs with specific domain terminology.",
    "priority": "High",
    "estimated_complexity": "M",
    "category": "core_platform"
  }
]

## Quality Checklist:
✅ Each epic directly supports the product vision above
✅ Epics address the specific target audience mentioned in the vision
✅ Business objectives and KPIs from the vision are considered
✅ Domain-specific requirements are incorporated (not generic)
✅ Epics can be developed in parallel where possible  
✅ Business value is clearly articulated in vision context

### Domain-Specific Validation:
For domain "${domain}":
- Epic titles and descriptions MUST use industry-specific terminology from the PRODUCT VISION
- Extract and use the EXACT business processes, assets, and workflows mentioned in the vision
- Reference the SPECIFIC stakeholders and user roles mentioned in the vision
- Use the EXACT terminology from the product vision above
- Avoid generic terms like "system", "platform", "application" unless domain-specific
- Focus on the SPECIFIC outcomes described in the vision, not generic software features

## CRITICAL: Respond with ONLY the JSON array. No markdown formatting, no code blocks, no explanations.

# Acceptance Criteria Refactoring Summary

## Issue Fixed
The decomposition agent was incorrectly creating acceptance criteria at the Feature level, which violates Azure DevOps best practices. According to ADO hierarchy standards:
- **Features** should focus on high-level business value and functionality
- **User Stories** should contain detailed acceptance criteria for testing and validation

## Changes Made

### 1. Prompt Template Updates (`prompts/decomposition_agent.txt`)
- **Removed**: Acceptance criteria from Feature structure requirements
- **Updated**: Feature output format to exclude acceptance criteria
- **Added**: Clear note that acceptance criteria belong to User Stories only
- **Enhanced**: Focus on business value, UI/UX requirements, and technical considerations for Features

### 2. Decomposition Agent Logic (`agents/decomposition_agent.py`)
- **Updated**: `decompose_feature_to_user_stories()` input parsing to remove feature acceptance criteria
- **Fixed**: Fallback user story generation to not inherit acceptance criteria from features
- **Enhanced**: User story generation with proper acceptance criteria at story level

### 3. Supervisor Workflow (`supervisor/supervisor.py`)
- **Updated**: QA generation stage to work at User Story level instead of Feature level
- **Changed**: `_execute_qa_generation()` to call:
  - `generate_user_story_test_cases()` instead of `generate_test_cases()`
  - `validate_user_story_testability()` instead of `validate_acceptance_criteria()`
- **Removed**: Legacy code that copied feature acceptance criteria to user stories
- **Added**: Test plan structure creation at feature level for organization

### 4. Azure DevOps Integration (`integrators/azure_devops_api.py`)
- **Updated**: Feature description formatting to exclude acceptance criteria
- **Enhanced**: Feature descriptions to include business value, UI/UX requirements, and technical considerations
- **Added**: Proper acceptance criteria field mapping for User Stories (`Microsoft.VSTS.Common.AcceptanceCriteria`)
- **Created**: `_format_acceptance_criteria_for_ado()` method for proper ADO field formatting
- **Updated**: User story description to exclude acceptance criteria (they go in dedicated field)
- **Updated**: Class documentation to reflect new structure

## ADO Field Mapping

### Features
```
- System.Title: Feature title
- System.Description: Business value + UI/UX requirements + technical considerations
- Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Priority: Priority level
- Microsoft.VSTS.Common.ValueArea: Business value area
```

### User Stories  
```
- System.Title: User story title
- System.Description: Story description + definition of ready/done
- Microsoft.VSTS.Common.AcceptanceCriteria: Formatted acceptance criteria (dedicated field)
- Microsoft.VSTS.Common.Priority: Priority level
- Microsoft.VSTS.Scheduling.StoryPoints: Story points estimate
```

## Benefits

1. **Compliance**: Aligns with Azure DevOps best practices and hierarchy standards
2. **Clarity**: Features focus on business value, User Stories focus on detailed requirements
3. **Testability**: Acceptance criteria are properly linked to testable User Stories
4. **Organization**: Test plans organize by Feature, test suites organize by User Story
5. **Searchability**: Acceptance criteria are in dedicated ADO fields, making them easily searchable

## Workflow Impact

### Before
```
Epic → Feature (with acceptance criteria) → User Story → Test Cases
```

### After  
```
Epic → Feature (business value only) → User Story (with acceptance criteria) → Test Cases
```

## QA Agent Focus
- **Removed**: All feature-level test generation methods
- **Enhanced**: User story-level test case generation with boundary/failure scenarios
- **Updated**: Test organization to create test suites per user story under feature test plans
- **Maintained**: Comprehensive testability analysis and acceptance criteria validation

This refactoring ensures that the system follows Azure DevOps best practices while maintaining all quality and testing capabilities at the appropriate work item levels.

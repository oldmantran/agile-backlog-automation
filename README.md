## ðŸ§­ Overview

This system automates the creation of Agile backlogsâ€”from Epics to Tasks and Bugsâ€”using a modular, multi-agent AI architecture. It simulates the roles of product strategists, developers, and QA testers using AI agents powered by Grok from xAI. It generates structured backlog items and pushes them directly into Azure DevOps via its REST API.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Automate generation of Epics, Features, User Stories, Tasks, and Bugs  
- Simulate human roles (Product Strategist, Developer, QA Tester) using AI agents  
- Integrate seamlessly with Azure DevOps for backlog population  
- Ensure modularity, configurability, and domain adaptability  

---

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Multi-agent architecture with centralized orchestration via a Supervisor  
- Configurable prompts and workflows using YAML/JSON  
- Role-specific agents: Epic Strategist, Feature Decomposer, Developer Agent, QA Tester Agent  
- Azure DevOps Integrator for creating and linking work items  
- Optional tools for estimation, validation, and test case generation  
- Support for custom fields, templates, and workflows per team/project

# 📘 Agile Backlog Automation System  
**Multi-agent AI system for automating Agile backlog creation with Grok and Azure DevOps**  
**Owner**: Kevin (Scrum Master)  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: June 2025 

---

## 🧭 Overview

This system automates the creation of Agile backlogs—from Epics to Tasks and Bugs—using a modular, multi-agent AI architecture. It simulates the roles of product strategists, developers, and QA testers using AI agents powered by Grok from xAI. It generates structured backlog items and pushes them directly into Azure DevOps via its REST API.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Automate generation of Epics, Features, User Stories, Tasks, and Bugs  
- Simulate human roles (Product Strategist, Developer, QA Tester) using AI agents  
- Integrate seamlessly with Azure DevOps for backlog population  
- Ensure modularity, configurability, and domain adaptability  

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- Multi-agent architecture with centralized orchestration via a Supervisor  
- Configurable prompts and workflows using YAML/JSON  
- Role-specific agents: Epic Strategist, Feature Decomposer, Developer Agent, QA Tester Agent  
- Azure DevOps Integrator for creating and linking work items  
- Optional tools for estimation, validation, and test case generation  
- Support for custom fields, templates, and workflows per team/project

## 👥 Target Users

- Scrum Masters  
- Product Owners  
- Agile Coaches  
- Software Development Teams

## 📌 CodeGuide Survey Answers

### 1. User Interface
Azure DevOps Extension (primary), CLI, optional web dashboard or VS Code extension.

### 2. Triggering Backlog Generation
Manual (on demand), event-based (e.g., new Epic), or scheduled (e.g., weekly grooming).

### 3. User-Provided Context
Product vision, stakeholder requirements, domain constraints via UI or YAML/JSON.

### 4. Configuration Management
Local YAML/JSON files with optional in-app editor.

### 5. Azure DevOps Authentication
PAT for MVP, OAuth or Service Principal for enterprise. Managed via `.env` or Key Vault.

### 6. Work Item Hierarchy & Linking

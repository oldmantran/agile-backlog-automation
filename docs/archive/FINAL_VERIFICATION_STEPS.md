# Final Verification Steps - Include Test Artifacts Feature

## Current Status
All code has been implemented and committed. The feature allows users to choose between:
- **Work Items + Testing** (default): Full backlog with test plans, suites, and cases
- **Work Items Only**: Just epics, features, user stories, and tasks (faster)

## Manual Verification Steps

### 1. Start the Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd X:\Programs\agile-backlog-automation
python unified_api_server.py

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd X:\Programs\agile-backlog-automation\frontend
npm start
```

### 2. Open the Application
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser

### 3. Verify the Feature
1. Click **"Create New Project"** in the navigation
2. Look for the **"Include Test Artifacts"** section in the form
3. You should see:
   - A toggle button that says "Enabled" (default) with a checkmark âœ“
   - Description text explaining the option
   - Processing time estimate that changes when toggled

### 4. Test the Toggle
- Click the toggle to switch to "Disabled" (shows X icon)
- Notice the processing time estimate changes from "~45-90 minutes" to "~15-30 minutes"
- The toggle should be visually distinct when enabled vs disabled

### 5. Test Submission (Optional)
Fill out the form and submit with the toggle disabled. Check the backend logs for:
- "Include test artifacts: False"
- "Excluding QA stages due to include_test_artifacts=False"

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. **Frontend**
   - `SimplifiedProjectForm.tsx`: Added toggle UI with visual feedback
   - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
   - Fixed syntax errors with literal \n characters

2. **Backend**
   - `unified_api_server.py`: API accepts includeTestArtifacts parameter
   - `supervisor.py`: Conditionally excludes qa_lead_agent stage

3. **Documentation**
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with feature description
   - Created test results documentation

## Troubleshooting

If you see compilation errors:
1. Make sure all files are saved
2. Restart the frontend server (Ctrl+C and npm start)
3. Clear browser cache and refresh

The feature is fully implemented and ready for use!

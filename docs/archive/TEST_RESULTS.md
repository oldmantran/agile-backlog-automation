# Test Results - Include Test Artifacts Feature

## Date: August 3, 2025

### Feature Overview
Added the ability for users to choose between:
- **Work Items Only**: Generates epics, features, user stories, and tasks (~15-30 minutes)
- **Work Items + Testing**: Includes test plans, test suites, and test cases (~45-90 minutes)

### Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Components Updated
1. **Frontend**
   - `SimplifiedProjectForm.tsx`: Added toggle with visual feedback
   - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
   - Shows processing time estimates based on selection

2. **Backend**
   - `unified_api_server.py`: API accepts and logs `includeTestArtifacts` parameter
   - `supervisor/supervisor.py`: Conditionally excludes QA stages when testing disabled
   - Fixed missing parameter in fallback initialization

3. **Documentation**
   - Updated `CLAUDE.md` with feature description
   - Added performance timing information

### Test Results

#### API Parameter Test ✅
- API correctly receives `includeTestArtifacts: false` in request
- Response includes the parameter value
- Backend logs show: "Include test artifacts: False"

#### Supervisor Integration Test ✅
- Supervisor receives the parameter correctly
- Log shows: "Testing artifacts disabled for workflow"
- Log shows: "Excluding QA stages due to include_test_artifacts=False"

#### Frontend Compilation ✅
- Fixed import errors in SimplifiedProjectForm.tsx
- Fixed FiRocket icon issue in NewProjectScreen.tsx
- Fixed malformed import in TronSettingsScreen.tsx
- Frontend builds and runs successfully

### Verification Steps Completed
1. ✅ Backend server starts without errors
2. ✅ Frontend server starts without errors
3. ✅ API endpoint accepts the new parameter
4. ✅ Supervisor logs show QA stage exclusion
5. ✅ Both workflow paths properly configured

### Known Issues
- Unicode characters in console output on Windows (cosmetic issue only)

### Conclusion
The feature has been successfully implemented and tested. Users can now choose whether to include test artifacts during backlog generation, significantly reducing processing time when testing is not immediately needed.

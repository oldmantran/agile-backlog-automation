# Temporary Implementation Notes and Plan
*Generated: July 9, 2025*

## Current System State

### ✅ COMPLETED ARCHITECTURE REFACTORING
- **Acceptance Criteria Management**: Successfully refactored entire system to ensure acceptance criteria are ONLY at User Story level (not Feature level)
- **Azure DevOps Best Practices**: Aligned work item hierarchy with industry standards
- **Agent Refactoring**: Updated all agents to work with new User Story-focused architecture
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive updates to reflect new architecture

### ✅ VALIDATED COMPONENTS
- **Backend API**: FastAPI server with User Story-focused workflow (`api_server.py`)
- **Frontend**: React + Chakra UI with mobile-first design
- **AI Agents**: All agents tested and working with new hierarchy
  - Epic Strategist ✅
  - Decomposition Agent (formerly Feature Decomposer) ✅
  - Developer Agent ✅
  - QA Tester Agent ✅
- **Complete Chain Test**: Full Epic → Feature → User Story → Task/Test Case workflow validated ✅

### ✅ WORK ITEM HIERARCHY (Azure DevOps Compliant)
```
Epic (High-level Business Goal)
├── Feature (Business Value - NO Acceptance Criteria)
│   ├── User Story (WITH Acceptance Criteria + Test Cases)
│   │   ├── Task (Development Work)
│   │   └── Test Case (QA Validation)
│   └── User Story (WITH Acceptance Criteria + Test Cases)
│       ├── Task (Development Work)
│       └── Test Case (QA Validation)
```

### ✅ KEY ARCHITECTURAL BENEFITS
1. **Compliance**: Follows Azure DevOps field mapping standards
2. **Clarity**: Clear separation between business value (Features) and testable requirements (User Stories)
3. **Traceability**: Test cases properly linked to User Stories
4. **Maintainability**: Focused agent responsibilities

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP: END-TO-END TESTING

### Test Scope
1. **Frontend Interface**: Complete project creation wizard
2. **Backend Processing**: User Story-focused backlog generation
3. **Azure DevOps Integration**: Work item creation with proper hierarchy
4. **Data Validation**: Ensure acceptance criteria only on User Stories

### Test Process
1. Start both frontend and backend servers
2. Create a test project through the UI
3. Monitor real-time generation progress
4. Validate generated backlog structure
5. Test Azure DevOps integration (if configured)
6. Verify acceptance criteria placement

### Expected Outcome
- Complete backlog generated with Epic → Feature → User Story → Task/Test Case hierarchy
- Acceptance criteria only on User Stories (mapped to `Microsoft.VSTS.Common.AcceptanceCriteria` field)
- Successful Azure DevOps work item creation
- Frontend correctly displays new hierarchy

## 🚀 AUTONOMOUS TEST EXECUTION AGENT PLAN

### Recommendation: NEW SEPARATE AGENT (Not Extension)
- **Rationale**: QA Tester Agent focuses on test case generation; Test Execution Agent focuses on automation
- **Architecture**: Independent agent with orchestration capabilities
- **Scalability**: Can be scaled separately based on execution workload

### Implementation Plan (Saved in `AUTONOMOUS_TEST_EXECUTION_AGENT_PLAN.md`)
1. **Core Agent**: Test execution orchestration
2. **Execution Engines**: Pluggable test runners (Playwright, Selenium, API tests)
3. **Result Processing**: Test outcome analysis and reporting
4. **Integration**: Hooks into existing User Story workflow
5. **Scaling**: Docker containers + cloud orchestration

## 📁 KEY FILES UPDATED

- `agents/decomposition_agent.py` - Refactored from feature_decomposer
- `agents/qa_tester_agent.py` - User Story-focused testing
- `supervisor/supervisor.py` - Updated workflow orchestration
- `integrators/azure_devops_api.py` - Proper field mapping
- `prompts/decomposition_agent.txt` - Updated prompt for new hierarchy
- `README.md` - Architecture documentation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete status overview
- `LATEST_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed architecture guide
- `AUTONOMOUS_TEST_EXECUTION_AGENT_PLAN.md` - Test automation plan

## 🔧 ENVIRONMENT STATUS
- **Python Backend**: Dependencies verified, all tests passing
- **Node.js Frontend**: Dependencies installed, build successful
- **Agent Chain**: Complete workflow validated
- **Azure DevOps**: API integration ready (requires .env configuration)

## 📋 POST-TESTING TODO
1. **Validate Results**: Confirm end-to-end workflow success
2. **Document Findings**: Update implementation summary with test results
3. **Address Issues**: Fix any discovered integration problems
4. **Plan Next Phase**: Consider implementing autonomous Test Execution Agent
5. **Production Readiness**: Security, authentication, error handling improvements

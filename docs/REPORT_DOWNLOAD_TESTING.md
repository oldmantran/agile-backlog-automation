# Testing Report Download Feature

## Overview
The backlog summary report feature has been implemented with a temporary test endpoint to bypass authentication issues during development.

## Testing Steps

1. **Start the Backend Server**
   ```bash
   python unified_api_server.py
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend Development Server**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Generate a Test Backlog**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000
   - Create a new project with any vision statement
   - Wait for the generation to complete

4. **Download the Summary Report**
   - Go to "My Projects" page
   - Find a completed project
   - Click the "Summary Report" button (with download icon)
   - The report should download as a markdown file

## Alternative Testing Method

If the UI download doesn't work, you can test directly:

```bash
# Replace 23 with your actual job ID
python test_report_download.py 23
```

This will download the report and save it as `test_report_23.md`.

## Report Contents

The summary report includes:
- Vision statement with quality score
- Backlog generation statistics
- Work item counts by type
- Task rejection analysis
- Performance metrics
- Quality insights and recommendations

## Troubleshooting

1. **404 Error**: Make sure the job ID exists in the database
2. **No Log File**: The system needs log files to generate detailed metrics
3. **Empty Report**: Check that the job has completed status

## Production Note

The test endpoint (`/api/reports/test/backlog/{job_id}/summary/download`) should be removed before production deployment. The authenticated endpoints should be used instead.

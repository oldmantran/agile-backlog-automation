# Agile Backlog Automation - Latest System Summary

**Updated: July 9, 2025**

## 📋 System Overview

The Agile Backlog Automation system is a sophisticated multi-agent AI solution that transforms product visions into structured, actionable backlogs. Built with Grok from xAI, the system generates epics, features, user stories, developer tasks, and QA test cases with full Azure DevOps integration following industry best practices.

## 🚀 Recent Major Updates

### 1. Acceptance Criteria Architecture Refactoring (Latest)
- **Azure DevOps Compliance**: Completely refactored to ensure acceptance criteria are exclusively managed at the User Story level
- **Feature Simplification**: Removed all acceptance criteria logic from Features, focusing them on business value
- **Enhanced Traceability**: Test cases and QA validation now properly linked to User Stories
- **Improved Field Mapping**: User Stories map acceptance criteria to `Microsoft.VSTS.Common.AcceptanceCriteria` field
- **Agent Refactoring**: Updated all agents and prompts to work with the new hierarchy

### 2. Full-Stack Implementation
- **React Frontend**: Modern, mobile-first UI with TypeScript and Chakra UI
- **FastAPI Backend**: REST API with real-time job processing and background tasks
- **Integration**: Seamless connection between frontend, backend, and AI agents

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### AI Agent Ecosystem
| Agent | Primary Responsibility | Input | Output | Latest Changes |
|-------|----------------------|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Epic Strategist** | Transform product vision into high-level epics | Product vision, business context | Structured epics with business value focus | No changes - maintains epic-level focus |
| **Decomposition Agent** | Break epics into features and user stories | Epics | Features (business value) + User Stories (with acceptance criteria) | **MAJOR REFACTOR** - Now creates User Stories with acceptance criteria |
| **Developer Agent** | Generate technical implementation tasks | User Stories | Development tasks with estimates | Updated to work with User Stories instead of Features |
| **QA Tester Agent** | Create comprehensive test strategies | User Stories with acceptance criteria | Test cases, edge cases, validation | **REFOCUSED** - Now operates exclusively at User Story level |

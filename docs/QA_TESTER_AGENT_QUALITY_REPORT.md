## Sample Test Case Quality

### Functional Test Example:
```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication
Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
Given: User is on the login page
When: User enters email 'testuser@example.com'
  And User enters password 'SecurePass123!'
  And User clicks 'Login' button
Then: User is redirected to the dashboard
  And User sees welcome message
  And User session is active
```

### Edge Case Example:
```
Title: SQL Injection attempt in login fields
Category: security_vulnerability
Risk Level: Critical
Description: Test for vulnerability to SQL injection attacks through login inputs
Expected Behavior: System sanitizes input, prevents login, and logs attempt for security monitoring
```

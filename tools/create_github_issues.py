                "body": '''## üß† FEATURE: Agent Learning System for Continuous Improvement

### Problem Statement
The current agentic backlog generator has sophisticated multi-agent architecture with quality assessment and improvement loops, but agents don't learn from past experiences. This leads to:
- Agents making the same mistakes repeatedly
- No improvement in performance over time
- Wasted resources on repeated improvement cycles
- Lack of domain-specific learning and optimization

### Current State
- ‚úÖ Multi-agent system with specialized agents (Epic Strategist, Feature Decomposer, User Story Decomposer, Developer Agent, QA Lead)
- ‚úÖ Quality assessment and improvement mechanisms
- ‚úÖ Circuit breaker pattern and timeout handling
- ‚úÖ Quality metrics tracking
- ‚ùå No learning from past experiences
- ‚ùå No pattern recognition for success/failure
- ‚ùå No continuous improvement based on historical data

### Proposed Solution: Agent Learning Architecture

#### 1. Agent Memory & Learning Database
Create a new database schema to store agent learning experiences:

**Tables:**
- `agent_learning_experiences` - Records of all agent executions with outcomes
- `agent_learning_patterns` - Identified success/failure patterns and strategies

**Key Fields:**
- Agent name, task type, domain
- Input context, output quality metrics
- Improvement attempts and strategies used
- Final outcome and lessons learned
- Performance metrics and context analysis

#### 2. Enhanced Base Agent with Learning
Modify `agents/base_agent.py` to include:
- Learning memory integration
- Experience recording capabilities
- Learning insights retrieval
- Prompt enhancement with historical learnings

**New Methods:**
- `_record_learning_experience()` - Store execution results
- `_get_learning_insights()` - Retrieve relevant learnings
- `_enhance_prompt_with_learning()` - Improve prompts with insights

#### 3. Learning-Enhanced Quality Assessment
Enhance `utils/quality_metrics_tracker.py` to:
- Record complete improvement cycles
- Extract lessons learned from failures
- Track improvement strategy effectiveness
- Generate learning recommendations

#### 4. Integration with Existing Agents
Update all specialized agents to:
- Record learning experiences during quality improvement cycles
- Use learning insights to enhance prompts
- Apply proven strategies from past successes
- Avoid repeating common failure patterns

#### 5. Learning Dashboard & Analytics
Create `tools/agent_learning_dashboard.py` for:
- Learning progress monitoring
- Performance trend analysis
- Strategy effectiveness tracking
- Actionable improvement recommendations

### Implementation Details

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- Learning experiences table
CREATE TABLE agent_learning_experiences (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    agent_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    task_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    domain TEXT NOT NULL,
    input_context TEXT NOT NULL,  -- JSON
    output_quality TEXT NOT NULL,  -- JSON
    improvement_attempts TEXT NOT NULL,  -- JSON
    final_outcome TEXT NOT NULL,
    lessons_learned TEXT NOT NULL,  -- JSON array
    timestamp TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    
    -- Performance metrics
    initial_score INTEGER,
    final_score INTEGER,
    improvement_count INTEGER,
    total_duration_seconds REAL,
    
    -- Context analysis
    context_length INTEGER,
    domain_specificity REAL,
    vision_clarity_score REAL
);

-- Learning patterns table
CREATE TABLE agent_learning_patterns (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    agent_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    task_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    domain TEXT NOT NULL,
    pattern_type TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'success_pattern', 'failure_pattern', 'improvement_strategy'
    pattern_data TEXT NOT NULL,  -- JSON
    confidence_score REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
    usage_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    success_rate REAL DEFAULT 0.0,
    last_updated TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Learning Experience Structure
```python
@dataclass
class LearningExperience:
    agent_name: str
    task_type: str  # 'epic', 'feature', 'user_story', 'task'
    domain: str
    input_context: Dict[str, Any]
    output_quality: Dict[str, Any]
    improvement_attempts: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    final_outcome: str  # 'success', 'partial_success', 'failure'
    lessons_learned: List[str]
    timestamp: datetime
```

#### Prompt Enhancement Example
```python
def _enhance_prompt_with_learning(self, base_prompt: str, task_type: str, 
                                domain: str = None, context: Dict[str, Any] = None) -> str:
    insights = self._get_learning_insights(task_type, domain)
    
    enhanced_prompt = f"""
{base_prompt}

## LEARNING-BASED IMPROVEMENTS
Based on analysis of {insights['insights']['total_experiences']} previous experiences:

{self._build_learning_instructions(insights, context)}

## PREVIOUS SUCCESS PATTERNS
{self._format_success_patterns(insights)}

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID
{self._format_failure_patterns(insights)}

Please apply these learnings to improve your output quality.

### Problem
After submitting a product vision and starting backlog generation, the application does not automatically navigate to the My Projects screen as expected. Users remain stuck on the project creation screen.

### Impact
- Users cannot monitor backlog generation progress
- Poor user experience - users think the system is broken
- Users manually navigate to My Projects screen
- Critical workflow interruption

### Current Behavior
- Project creation succeeds
- Backlog generation API call is made
- Success message shows for 2 seconds
- Navigation to `/my-projects` fails or doesn't happen
- User remains on project creation screen

### Expected Behavior
- After successful backlog generation start
- Immediate navigation to My Projects screen
- Show progress bar and server logs
- Allow user to monitor generation progress

### Location
- `frontend/src/screens/project/SimpleProjectWizard.tsx` (lines 70-90)
- Navigation logic in `handleSubmit` function

### Root Cause
- Navigation timeout may be failing
- React Router navigation may not be working properly
- Success state may not be triggering correctly

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Navigation to My Projects screen happens immediately after backlog generation starts
- [ ] No 2-second delay - navigate immediately
- [ ] Fallback navigation works if React Router fails
- [ ] User sees progress bar and server logs on My Projects screen
- [ ] No manual navigation required

- No visibility into server logs and processing status
- Users think the system is not working
- Critical monitoring functionality broken

### Current Behavior

- No indication that backlog generation is running
- API calls may be failing silently

### Expected Behavior

### Location
- `frontend/src/screens/project/MyProjectsScreen.tsx`

- Server Logs component may not be rendering
- Active jobs not being loaded from localStorage or API
- WebSocket connection may not be established

### Acceptance Criteria

### Location
Frontend state management

### Recommendation
Persist progress in localStorage or database.

### Acceptance Criteria

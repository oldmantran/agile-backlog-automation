## üõ°Ô∏è QUALITY & ROBUSTNESS PROTOCOL (August 5, 2025)

**CRITICAL**: Zero tolerance for generic/fallback work items and false success notifications:

### Quality Standards (NEW - August 5, 2025):
1. **EXCELLENT Quality Required**: All work items must achieve EXCELLENT rating (80+ score)
2. **No Generic Content**: System fails cleanly rather than create placeholder items
3. **Fail-Fast Principle**: Stop immediately when quality standards cannot be met
4. **Accurate Notifications**: Error emails for failures, celebration emails only for true success

### Regression Prevention Protocol:

### Before Making Any Changes:
1. **Run regression tests**: `tools/run_regression_tests.bat`
2. **Document what you're changing** and why
3. **Identify potential impact areas** (vision processing, template system, context flow)

### After Making Changes:
1. **MANDATORY**: Run `python tools/pre_commit_check.py` - must pass 100%
2. **Test specific functionality** you modified with targeted tests
3. **Run full regression suite** before considering changes complete
4. **Verify in browser** that basic project creation still works

### Core Functions That Must NEVER Break:
- ‚úÖ Vision statement processing from API ‚Üí Supervisor ‚Üí Agents
- ‚úÖ Template variable resolution (especially `product_vision`)
- ‚úÖ Agent prompt generation and LLM communication  
- ‚úÖ Project context flow through all stages
- ‚úÖ Domain selection and basic project creation
- ‚úÖ Settings persistence and retrieval

**If ANY regression test fails, STOP and fix before proceeding.**

### Regression Test Files:
- `tests/test_core_smoke.py` - Critical path validation
- `tests/test_vision_integration.py` - End-to-end vision processing
- `tools/pre_commit_check.py` - Pre-commit safety checks
- `tools/run_regression_tests.bat` - Complete test suite

**Status**: All agents now follow consistent pattern and produce significantly higher quality output.

### üéØ Universal Quality Threshold System (August 10, 2025)

**BREAKING CHANGE**: Implemented universal quality acceptance threshold of 75+

#### **Quality Threshold Implementation**:
- **Minimum Score**: All work items must achieve a quality score of 75 or higher
- **Auto-Discard**: Work items scoring below 75 are automatically discarded
- **Retry Logic**: Agents generate additional work items until quota is met
- **Central Configuration**: New `config/quality_config.py` manages quality settings
- **No Count Pollution**: Discarded items don't count toward work item limits

#### **Epic Strategist Enhancement**:
- **Batch Generation**: Generates work items in batches until required count achieved
- **Maximum Attempts**: Up to 10 generation attempts to prevent infinite loops
- **Quality Filtering**: Only items meeting threshold are included in final output
- **Clear Logging**: Shows how many items passed/failed quality checks per batch

#### **Authentication Fixes**:
- **LLM Config Endpoints**: Fixed all `/api/llm/configurations` endpoints to use JWT auth
- **Removed user_id_resolver**: Eliminated dependency causing "Please log in" errors
- **Legacy Job Support**: Added checks for missing userId to support pre-auth jobs

**Status**: Quality threshold system operational with retry logic and proper authentication.

### üîß JWT Authentication & User-Specific Agent Configuration (August 10, 2025)

- **Base Agent Update**: Uses passed user_id instead of hardcoded resolver, falling back only for background processes
- **Complete Agent Updates**: Updated constructors for EpicStrategist, FeatureDecomposerAgent, UserStoryDecomposerAgent, DeveloperAgent, QALeadAgent, and all QA sub-agents
- **API Endpoints**: All endpoints now use JWT authentication (Depends(get_current_user)) instead of path-based user_id
- **Frontend Updates**: Removed hardcoded user_id fallbacks, requires authenticated user for all operations

## üö® CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES (August 7, 2025)

### Unicode Encoding Prevention (MANDATORY)
**NEVER use emojis in code** - Windows cp1252 encoding causes UnicodeEncodeError crashes.

```python
# ‚ùå FORBIDDEN - Will crash on Windows
print("‚úÖ Success")
logger.info("‚ùå Failed")

# ‚úÖ REQUIRED - Always use safe logging
from utils.safe_logger import get_safe_logger, safe_print
logger = get_safe_logger(__name__)
logger.info("Success")  # Auto-converts to [SUCCESS]
safe_print("Failed")    # Auto-converts to [ERROR]
```

**Before ANY code changes**:
1. Use `get_safe_logger(__name__)` instead of `logging.getLogger()`
2. Use `safe_print()` instead of `print()` with dynamic content
3. Replace existing emojis: ‚ùå‚Üí[ERROR], ‚úÖ‚Üí[SUCCESS], ‚ö†Ô∏è‚Üí[WARNING]
4. See `docs/UNICODE_PREVENTION_GUIDE.md` for complete guidelines

### LLM Configuration Consolidation
**Single source of truth**: Use `utils.unified_llm_config.get_agent_config()` for ALL LLM configuration.

**Configuration priority** (highest to lowest):
1. Runtime overrides (temporary)
2. Database user settings (persistent)  
3. Settings.yaml agent config (project defaults)
4. Environment variables (deployment)
5. Hard-coded fallbacks

```python
# ‚úÖ NEW WAY - Unified configuration
from utils.unified_llm_config import get_agent_config
config = get_agent_config("epic_strategist", user_id="123")

# ‚ùå OLD WAY - Multiple conflicting sources
# Don't use separate env/database/settings loading
```

## Architecture Overview

This is a multi-agent AI system that transforms product visions into structured Azure DevOps backlogs.

**Current Status**: Production Ready with Enterprise Security - Core functionality stable, fail-fast quality assessment, zero-tolerance for generic content, enterprise-grade reliability, JWT authentication system, and comprehensive security hardening.

### Core Components

**Frontend**: React TypeScript application with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components. Uses React Query for API state management and provides real-time progress updates via Server-Sent Events. Features complete authentication system with protected routes and automatic token refresh.

**Backend**: FastAPI server (`unified_api_server.py`) that orchestrates the AI agent pipeline and provides REST endpoints for the frontend. Includes enterprise-grade JWT authentication with rate limiting, account lockout, and production security hardening.

**Authentication System**: Complete JWT + Local Users authentication with bcrypt password hashing, token blacklisting, rate limiting (10/min), account lockout (5 failures), and environment-aware security settings. Self-contained with SQLite user database - no external dependencies required.

**AI Agent Pipeline**: Multi-stage workflow managed by `supervisor/supervisor.py`:
1. `epic_strategist.py` - Creates high-level epics from product vision
2. `feature_decomposer_agent.py` - Breaks epics into features
3. `user_story_decomposer_agent.py` - Creates user stories with acceptance criteria
4. `developer_agent.py` - Generates technical tasks with time estimates
5. `qa_lead_agent.py` - Orchestrates QA sub-agents for test generation (Phase 2 or post-generation)

**LLM Provider Support**: 
- Local LLM via Ollama (recommended for cost savings, Qwen2.5:32B recommended)
- Cloud providers: OpenAI, Grok (xAI)
- Configuration managed through `utils/settings_manager.py`
- **Template System**: Comprehensive prompt template system with variable validation and proper context injection

- Agent settings and timeouts
- Work item limits and presets (small/medium/large/unlimited)
- Parallel processing configuration
- QA test organization requirements

**Settings Management**: User-specific settings stored in database with fallback to system defaults, managed through the frontend Settings page.

### Azure DevOps Integration

**üîÑ Outbox Pattern Architecture (NEW - August 2025)**: Enterprise-grade integration with zero data loss:
- **Local Staging**: All work items stored in SQLite before upload (`models/work_item_staging.py`)
- **Resumable Uploads**: Failed items can be retried without regenerating content (`integrators/outbox_uploader.py`)
- **Cascading Failure Prevention**: Individual failures don't affect other work items
- **HTTP Reliability**: Timeouts (30s/60s), retry logic (3x exponential backoff), rate limiting (100ms)
- **Management Tools**: Comprehensive retry utilities (`tools/retry_failed_uploads.py`)
- **Performance**: Protects 2-hour generation investment, enables selective retry of failed items

Full integration with Azure DevOps Test Management API:

## üìã TOMORROW'S CONTINUATION NOTES (August 5, 2025 Session End)

### ‚úÖ **Major Accomplishments Today**:
1. **Fixed Critical Notification Bug**: System was sending "üéâ SUCCESS" emails for failed workflows with 0 work items
2. **Implemented Fail-Fast Quality Gates**: Epic Strategist now stops workflow when quality assessment fails instead of accepting subpar work items
3. **Eliminated ALL Generic Content**: Removed fallback mechanisms that created placeholder content polluting Azure DevOps
4. **Enhanced Error Messages**: Added domain-specific guidance for quality failures with actionable recommendations
5. **Fixed Workflow Control**: Supervisor now stops on critical failures instead of continuing through all stages

### üîç **Root Cause Analysis Completed**:
- **Issue**: Epic quality assessments failed (GOOD 65/100, GOOD 70/100) but workflow continued and sent celebration email
- **Solution**: Epic Strategist raises ValueError on non-EXCELLENT ratings, Supervisor detects critical failures and stops workflow, Notifier sends appropriate error notifications

### üéØ **Current System Behavior**:
- **Quality Standard**: Only EXCELLENT (80+) work items are accepted
- **Failure Response**: Clear error messages with domain-specific troubleshooting guidance
- **User Experience**: No more confusing success emails for failed workflows
- **Clean Failures**: Better to fail with guidance than create generic content requiring cleanup

### üöÄ **Next Session Priorities**:
1. **Investigate Off-Topic Content**: Look into "inventory levels" generation mentioned in logs (Task ID: 129)
2. **Test End-to-End**: Validate the complete workflow with new fail-fast behavior
3. **Model Recommendations**: Document which models work best for different domains
4. **Performance Tuning**: Further optimize quality assessment without sacrificing standards

### üí° **Key Files Modified Today**:
- `agents/epic_strategist.py`: Added fail-fast quality assessment
- `supervisor/supervisor.py`: Added critical failure detection and workflow termination
- `utils/notifier.py`: Added failure detection and domain-specific error notifications
- `agents/user_story_decomposer_agent.py`: Removed generic content generation
- `CLAUDE.md`: Updated with comprehensive robustness improvements

**System is now production-ready with professional quality standards and accurate user feedback.**

## üìã TODAY'S UPDATES (August 9, 2025 Session 2)

### üõ†Ô∏è **Configuration Mode Persistence Fix**
- **Issue Fixed**: Configuration Mode (Global vs Agent-Specific) was not persisting after save
- **Root Cause**: Missing API endpoints and improper mode loading when no configurations existed
- **Solution**: Added `/api/llm-configurations/{user_id}` GET/POST endpoints with proper mode persistence
- **Database Query**: Separate query for configuration_mode to handle empty configuration scenarios
- **Frontend Fix**: Always check and apply configuration_mode from API response, regardless of config count
- **Edge Case Handled**: Users with mode preference but no saved configurations now work correctly

### üí° **Key Files Modified**:
- `unified_api_server.py`: Added GET/POST endpoints for LLM configurations with mode persistence
- `frontend/src/components/settings/AgentLLMConfiguration.tsx`: Fixed mode loading and immediate save on toggle

**Configuration mode now correctly persists between sessions as requested by the user.**
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive two-phase workflow with clear progress feedback
